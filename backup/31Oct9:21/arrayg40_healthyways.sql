(1, 'Emotional eating dependence', 'images/pdf_report/EmotionalEating.jpg', 'Emotional eating is a form of disordered eating, and it is defined as an increase in food intake in response to emotions. Some people have a strong emotional connection with food. Such people can turn to food for comfort consciously or subconsciously, when facing a difficult problem, feeling stressed, or even while feeling bored. Emotional eating can lead to excessive calorie intake, thereby damaging any weight loss efforts. Such a response to food can be triggered due to variations in certain genes.'),
(2, 'Snacking pattern', 'images/pdf_report/SnackingPattern.jpg', 'Eating behavior is a complex interplay of physiological, psychological, social, and genetic factors that influence meal timing, quantity of food intake, food preference, and food selection. Even after a meal, some individuals tend to look for snacks or more meals. Such people have an increased urge to snack on foods throughout the day even though they feel full. Variations in certain genes are involved in poor snacking pattern, resulting in overeating.'),
(3, 'Satiety response', 'images/pdf_report/safetyResponse.jpg', 'Satiety means feeling of fullness or suppression of hunger for a period of time after a meal. Certain genetic variations can influence the ability to feel satiated after consumption of a meal, which can lead to overeating for individuals with a poor satiety response. Over eating can lead to an excessive calorie intake, thereby increasing the risk of weight gain.'),
(4, 'Sweet taste perception', 'images/pdf_report/SweetTastPerception.jpg', 'Sweet taste perception is the ability of our taste buds to sense sweet foods. Taste perception explains the individual food preferences and the impact of eating behavior and nutritional intake. Generally, the less sensitive ones are likely to consume more of that food and tend to overeat. Taste buds for sweet taste perception are usually found at the back of the tongue and the roof of the mouth. Genetic variations in the genes encoding taste receptors influence the inter- individual differences observed in sweet taste perception. People with certain variants are poor sweet taste perceivers, and therefore tend to consume sugars in higher amounts.'),
(5, 'Bitter taste perception', 'images/pdf_report/BitterTastePerception.jpg', 'Bitter taste perception is the ability of our taste buds to sense bitter foods. Taste perception explains the individual food preferences and the impact of eating behavior and nutritional intake. Generally, the less sensitive ones are more likely to consume that food and tend to overeat. Lower perception of bitter taste is generally associated with increased consumption of bitter foods, which could possibly lead to toxicity in the body under adverse conditions. Genetic variations in the genes encoding taste receptors are responsible for differences in bitter taste perception.'),
(6, 'Fatty food preference', 'images/pdf_report/FattyFoodPreference.jpg', 'Fatty food preference tells us about our taste-based preference for foods rich in fats, such as deep fried foods, nuts, cheese, and red meats.

Preference for fatty foods is governed by certain genetic variations which can largely influence our fatty food intake.'),
(7, 'Response to Carbohydrates', 'images/pdf_report/ResponseToCarbohydrates.jpg', 'Carbohydrates are important macro nutrients and the primary source of energy and calories for the body. Carbohydrates are primarily divided into simple carbohydrate and complex carbohydrate groups. Simple carbohydrates are quickly broken down and absorbed by the body, which leads to a spike in the blood sugar levels and insulin secretion. Increased consumption of simple carbohydrates such as refined flour, table sugar, syrups, and fruit drinks could increase the risk of developing diabetes and obesity. Complex carbohydrates, due to their complex structure, cannot be quickly broken down, causing slow and sustained release of sugar and insulin into the bloodstream. Complex carbohydrate sources include oats, quinoa, brown rice, barley, and legumes. Genetic variations can influence the risk of developing insulin resistance and obesity in response to carbohydrate consumption.'),
(8, 'Response to saturated fats', 'images/pdf_report/ResponseToSaturatedFats.jpg', 'Saturated fats are a class of macro nutrients which are used for energy generation by the body. Saturated fats are found in butter,ghee, margarine, and in animal fats. They differ from other types of fats with respect to the number of double bonds in their backbone, with saturated fats having none. They tend to have higher melting points compared to unsaturated fats, which are generally liquid at room temperature. Saturated fats, when consumed in higher amounts compared to other fats are known to increase LDL cholesterol, which leads to deposition of plaques along the walls of the blood vessels, causing narrowing of blood vessels. This directly leads to an increase in the risk of developing cardiovascular diseases. Genetic variations can influence how the body responds to saturated fat intake, in terms of developing abnormal lipid profiles and obesity.'),
(9, 'Response to Monosaturated fats', 'images/pdf_report/ResponseToMonounsaturatedFats.jpg', 'Monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA) are a type of fat which contain one double bond in their backbone. These fats are usually liquid at room temperature. Monounsaturated fats also play a critical role in regulating the body’s immune function. Eating monounsaturated fats instead of saturated fats and trans fats can lower cholesterol levels and reduce the risk of heart disease and stroke. Monounsaturated fats are also high in vitamin E, an antioxidant vitamin that keeps the body healthy by protecting cells from damage. Foods like avocados, peanut butter, nuts, seeds, olive oil, peanut oil, canola oil, sesame oil, and sunflower oil are particularly high in monounsaturated fats. Genetic variations can influence the degree of health benefits observed with MUFA intake.'),

PUFA rich sources include olive oil, soybean oil, corn oil, and sunflower oil. Other sources include seeds such as walnuts and flax seeds. PUFAs at room temperatures are liquids. PUFAs can help reduce LDL cholesterol levels in the blood which can subsequently lower the risk of heart disease and stroke. Oils rich in polyunsaturated fats also contribute vitamin E, an antioxidant vitamin that keeps the body healthy by protecting cells from damage. There are two main types of PUFA, omega 3 and omega 6 fatty acids. Omega 3 PUFAs are anti-inflammatory and found in fatty fish, shellfish, liver, and in some seeds like flax seed. Omega 6 rich foods are predominantly present in animal fats. The ideal ratio of omega 6 to omega 3 is around 2:1 to 4:1, but modern diets contain ratios ranging from 15:1 to even 25:1, which leads to a much increased dietary need for omega 3 intake for most individuals. Genetic variations can influence the dietary requirement for omega 3 PUFA intake.'),
(11, 'Response to protein', 'images/pdf_report/ResponseToProtein.jpg', 'Protein is an essential macro nutrient required by the body for growth and maintenance. It acts as a building block for all the cells in the body and can also serve as a fuel source. When broken down into amino acids, they are used as precursors to several other molecules essential for life. A protein-rich diet boosts metabolism and reduces appetite. Therefore, consumption of proteins invokes a feeling of fullness, decreases total calorie consumption, and reduces appetite over time, which aids in fat loss and weight maintenance. Dietary sources of protein include both animals and plant proteins, which include meats, dairy products, fish, eggs, grains, legumes, and nuts. Genetic variations can lead to altered response to increased protein consumption in terms of maintaining lost weight.'),
(12, 'Response to fibre', 'images/pdf_report/ResponseToFiber.jpg', 'Dietary fiber is a type of carbohydrate that cannot be digested by the body. The primary role of dietary fiber is in bowel function. Dietary fiber,particularly insoluble fiber,helps prevent constipation by increasing stool weight and decreasing the time of transit of stools in the gut. It also helps in lowering the risks of heart disease and diabetes. Fiber based foods retain water in the intestine which helps to fee lfuller,thereby keeping excessive calorie intake in check, which reduces the risk of developing obesity. It is commonly found in fruits, vegetable, pulses, and whole grains. Genetic variations can influence the extent of benefit that increased fiber intake can have on keeping weight in check.'),
(13, 'Ability to maintain the weight loss', 'images/pdf_report/AbilityToMaintainWeightLoss.jpg', 'While losing weight is difficult for many people, it is equally challenging to keep the weight off. A significant number of people who lose a large amount of weight tend to regain it 1 to 3 years later. Certain genetic variations can influence the ability to maintain body weight post weight loss. This increases the importance of following a healthy nutrition plan and exercise regimen to maintain the weight loss for those people who are at a higher genetic risk for regaining lost weight.'),
(14, 'Vitamin A Metabolism', 'images/pdf_report/VitaminAMetabolism.jpg', 'Vitamin A is a group of nutritional organic compounds which are of primary importance in the process of vision. It also plays an important role in the immune function of the body and in maintaining skin health. Animal sources like organ meat, fish, and milk products provide vitamin A in the form of retinol or retinoic acid, while plant sources like carrots, sweet potatoes, spinach, kale, and cantaloupes provide the precursor of vitamin A in the form of carotenes, which are converted into retinol inside the body. Some symptoms related to vitamin A deficiency include night blindness, acne, or dry skin. Excess vitamin A in the body could lead to abdominal pain, muscle pain, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. Genetic variations can affect the process of beta-carotene conversion to retinol, thereby influencing dietary vitamin A requirement.'),

Hypertension results from a complex interaction of genes and environmental factors. Lifestyle factors that increase the risk include excess salt in the diet, excess body weight, smoking, and excess alcohol consumption. Unmanaged hypertension can lead to heart attack, stroke, and other health problems. '),
(48, 'Obesity', 'images/pdf_report/obesity.jpg', 'Obesity is a condition involving excessive body fat that increases the risk of health problems. Obesity often results from taking in more calories than are burned by exercise and normal daily activities. Body mass index of more than 30, indicates obesity. Excessive body fat increases the risk of serious health problems. '),
(49, 'Acne', 'images/pdf_report/Acne.jpg', 'Acne, or acne vulgaris, is one of the most common dermatological conditions. It is a chronic inflammatory disease of the pilosebaceous unit (comprising the hair follicle, hair shaft, and sebaceous gland). It is characterised by comedones, papules, pustules, nodules, cysts, and/or scarring, primarily on the face and trunk. Hormonal changes lead to increased production of sebum and causes acne of varying severity. '),
(50, 'Striae Distensae', 'images/pdf_report/StriaeDistensae.jpg', 'Striae distensae, commonly known as stretch marks, are a form of scarring on the skin with erythematous (red), violaceous, or hypopigmented linear striations (means a series of ridges, furrows, or linear marks) occuring due to stretching of the dermis (the inner layer of skin) when skin changes shape rapidly due to growth or weight gain. There are two main types of striae distensae, striae rubra and striae alba. Striae rubra are acute presentation of striae distensae and are characterized by an erythematous (red) to violaceous color. Over time, striae rubra evolve into striae alba, which appear hypopigmented, atrophic, and scar-like.'),
(51, 'Alopecia', 'images/pdf_report/Alopecia.jpg', 'Alopecia is a skin condition characterized by sudden hair loss. The two types of alopecia are Alopecia areata (AA) and Androgenic alopecia (AGA). AA is a T cell dependent autoimmune hair loss disease that is specific to the skin. AGA is characterized by thinning of hair and a receding hairline. It is believed to be caused by increased activity of androgen receptors in hair follicles, but it is unclear how it leads to hairloss. However, its affiliation with disorders associated with increased androgen levels such as coronary heart disease and prostate cancer in men and polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) in women as a potential cause. '),
(52, 'Sunburns', 'images/pdf_report/Sunburns.jpg', 'Sunburn is the skin\'s reaction to overexposure to ultraviolet radiation, either from sunlight or artificial sources. It manifests as red, inflamed patches on the exposed skin. Development of sunburns depend on the intensity of ultraviolet radiation and genetic capability to produce melanin. In fair-skinned people, melanin levels are low, therefore ultraviolet rays penetrate the upper layer of the skin and cause direct DNA damage, triggering several defence mechanisms. '),
(53, 'Sun spots', 'images/pdf_report/SunSpots.jpg', 'Sunspots are harmless, noncancerous flat brown spots that develop on areas of skin which are exposed to the sun, such as face, shoulders, back, and the backs of the hands. They do not pose any risk to the health or require treatment unless for cosmetic reasons. These discoloration spots can be tan or varying shades of brown. They often start to appear around the age of 40 years, though some people may develop them earlier or later in life, depending on the amount of sun exposure they have had. '),
(54, 'Tanning Ability', 'images/pdf_report/TanningAbility.jpg', 'Tanning ability is a protective response of your skin on overexposure to ultraviolet light. The skin increases the production of melanin and distributes it to the affected region preventing further damage of the genetic material (DNA). People with good tanning ability have a lowered risk of skin cancer and can produce a natural tan that provides a modest Sun Protection Factor (SPF). People with light skin, blue eyes, and red or blond hair have a poor ability to tan. Over exposure to ultraviolet radiation and decreased tanning ability significantly increases the risk for skin cancer. '),
(55, 'Psoriasis', 'images/pdf_report/Psoriasis.jpg', 'Psoriasis is an autoimune skin disease leading to faster growth of skin cells. It is characterized by red patches of skin covered with thick, silvery scales and small scaling spots. An overactive immune system causes T-cells (immune cells)to attack healthy skin cells, resulting in increased production of healthy skin cells, which leads to scaly patches, redness, and sometimes pus. Other conditions associated with psoriasis include cardiovascular diseases, obesity, diabetes, metabolic syndrome, Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD), and psoriatic arthritis, which contribute to decreased longevity. '),
(56, 'Eczema', 'images/pdf_report/Eczema.jpg', 'Eczema refers to various conditions causing inflammation of the skin. Atopic Dermatitis (AD) is the commonest type of eczema. It is a chronic relapsing inflammatory skin disease that is commonly associated with food allergy, allergic rhinitis, and asthma. AD usually develops in early childhood and is more common in people who have a family history of the condition. Extremes of hot and cold weather are poorly tolerated by patients with AD and can lead to sweating and dry skin leading to itchy skin. In childhood, wool has been found to be a known trigger for AD. '),
(57, 'Vitiligo', 'images/pdf_report/Vitiligo.jpg', 'Vitiligo is an autoimmune disorder causing whitening of the skin and presents as milky white patches, caused due to destruction of pigment forming cells (melanocytes). There are two types of vitiligo, non-segmental vitiligo and segmental vitiligo. Non-segmental vitiligo is the commonest form, characterised by symmetrical and bilateral white patches. Segmental vitiligo lesions are characterised by unilateral and segmental or band-shaped distribution, with an early age of onset. '),
(58, 'Pemphigus Foliaceus', 'images/pdf_report/PemphigusFoliaceus.jpg', 'Pemphigus Foliaceus (PF) is an acquired autoimmune blistering disease, occuring when the immune system makes antibodies against the skin and mucous membranes. It is characterized by blisters, cuts, and crusty spots on the skin and mucous membranes. PF is usually found on the face, scalp, and upper chest and back. There are two predominant types of PF, idiopathic PF, which is seen in people universally and Fogo Selvagem, which is seen in people from distinct geographical areas. '),
(59, 'Endurance', 'images/pdf_report/Endurance.jpg', 'Endurance is the ability of the body to sustain a physical activity for a prolonged period of time. A high endurance capacity indicates that an individual can take up mild to moderate intensity activities for a prolonged duration with minimal discomforts like breathlessness and fatigue. Endurance performance is dictated by factors such as the aerobic capacity, fat oxidation, aerobic metabolism, lactate threshold, exercise economy, and percentage of slow twitch muscle fibers. Genetics play a big role in these factors, and hence dictate whether an individual is suited for endurance activities or not.'),
(60, 'Aerobic capacity Trainability', 'images/pdf_report/Aerobic_capacity_Trainability.jpg', 'Aerobic capacity, also known as VO2Max, is defined as the maximum capacity of our body to transport and use oxygen during exercise. During aerobic exercises, oxygen is used to break down the fuel stores for energy production and its demand increases with increase in the intensity of exercise. Appropriate training leads to an improvement in the aerobic capacity which directly translates to improved performance. However, the extent and the ease at which these improvements are made is governed by genetics. People with favourable genetics find it very easy to improve their aerobic capacity, while others can find it very dificult. Various genes that are involved in cellular oxygen supply and utilization regulate the trainability of aerobic capacity.'),
(61, 'Lactate Threshold', 'images/pdf_report/LactateThreshold.jpg', 'Lactate is produced by the body during anaerobic glycolysis. This lactate is further used as a fuel by the aerobic metabolism pathway for energy generation. However,during intense exercise, the aerobic system is not able to use up all the lactate produced by the anaerobic system which results in an increase in the concentration of lactate. This directly correlates with muscle fatigue. Therefore, lactate threshold is defined as the intensity of exercise at which the concentration of lactate begins to exponentially increase, thereby setting in fatigue. Intensity of exercise below the lactate threshold can be done without any apparent feeling of uneasiness and fatigue. Therefore, a higher lactate threshold leads to an improved performance since higher intensity of exercise can be achieved.'),
(62, 'Power', 'images/pdf_report/Power.jpg', 'Power is the ability of the muscles to generate large forces at a rapid rate, as observed during high intensity activities of shorter duration. Activities such as jumping, powerlifting, sprinting, bodybuilding, and short-distance swimming utilize the power generation capabilities of the muscle. Generally, a greater power output directly translates into improved performance in such activities. Genetics play a big role in the power generation capabilities of an individual, and hence dictate whether an individual is suited for power activities or not.'),
(63, 'Achilles Tendinopathy', 'images/pdf_report/AchillesTendinopathy.jpg', 'The achilles tendon attaches muscles at the back of the lower leg to the heel bone. It is the thickest tendon in the human body. Achilles tendinopathy is an overuse injury that is common, especially to people performing running and jumping activities, due to the repetitive action at the achilles tendon. It can also be caused by other factors such as trauma, rheumatoid arthritis, wearing high heel shoes, and certain medications. Symptoms can vary from an ache or pain and swelling in the local area of the ankles to a burning sensation that surrounds the whole joint. The pain associated with this condition is usually worse during and after activity and the tendon and joint area can become stiffer the following day, as swelling hampers the movement of the tendon.'),
(64, 'Concussion', 'images/pdf_report/Concussion.jpg', 'Concussion is a temporary unconsciousness or confusion caused by a blow to the head or by violent shaking of the head and body. It temporarily affects brain functioning and may lead to temporary cognitive problems. Some symptoms may begin immediately, while others may appear days after the injury. Post a concussion, even after the symptoms are reversed, the neurons in the brain remain in a vulnerable state for some time, and another concussion during this period of vulnerability may lead to permanent damage to those neurons. Therefore, it is advised to take an extended period of rest even after the symptoms are reversed. Genetics play a role with respect to an individual\'s risk of getting concussed and the vulnerability period after a concussion.'),
(65, 'Anterior cruciate ligament Injury', 'images/pdf_report/AnteriorcruciateligamentInjury.jpg', 'There are four main ligaments which connect the thigh bone to the shin bone at the knee joint, the Anterior Cruciate Ligament (ACL) is one of them. The ACL serves several functions, making it extremely essential for providing stability to the knee joint and aiding in its function. It prevents the shin bone from moving too far forward with respect to the thigh bone. It prevents excessive internal rotation of the shin bone and knee hyper extension beyond the point of maximal knee extension. Lastly, it also helps protect the knee from excessive sideways forces such as when a rugby player is tackled from the side. ACL injuries most commonly occur during activities that involve sudden stops, jumping or changes in direction, performed with improper technique. An ACL tear is one of the most common knee injuries, requiring a complex surgery with a prolonged recovery time usually ranging from 6-9 months. Therefore, gauging a person’s risk for ACL injury is absolutely essential before undertaking such activities which can potentially damage the ACL.'),
(66, 'Muscle Injury', 'images/pdf_report/MuscleInjury.jpg', 'Exercise puts stress on the muscles, which leads to damage. Low level damage is essential for the muscles to grow and adapt to the exercise stimuli. However, if a muscle gets excessively damaged, it can lead to muscle strains. A strain is a contraction-induced injury in which muscle fibers tear due to extensive mechanical stress. Other muscle injuries include bruises, neuromuscular disorders, and cramps. Muscle injuries result in pain, functional loss of the involved muscle, and hence an inability to perform the particular exercise/sport. An individual’s genetic profile can dictate their propensity for muscle injuries.'),
(67, 'Rotator cuff Injury', 'images/pdf_report/RotatorcuffInjury.jpg', 'The rotator cuff is a group of four tendons that stabilize the shoulder joint. It functions in keeping the head of the upper arm bone firmly within the socket of the joint. Rotator cuff injury is the damage to the rotator cuff from a traumatic event or from repetitive shoulder joint movements as observed in many sports/exercises. This can lead to minor strain injury,partial tear of the tendons or complete tear of tendons, with loss of shoulder joint function. It manifests as a dull ache in the shoulder and pain while trying to move the shoulder joint. An individual’s genetic profile can dictate their propensity for rotator  cuffinjury.'),
(68, 'Tennis Elbow', 'images/pdf_report/TennisElbow.jpg', 'Tennis Elbow, also known as lateral elbow tendinopathy, is a condition in which the outer part of the elbow becomes painful and tender. It occurs when tendons in the elbow are overloaded, usually by repetitive motions of the wrist and arms. It is commonly observed in people undertaking racquet sports. However, other activities eliciting such repetitive motions can also cause tennis elbow. A repetitive motion like gripping a racket during a swing can strain the muscles and put too much stress on the tendons. This constant tugging can eventually cause small tears in the tissue, leading to injury.'),
(69, 'Flexibility', 'images/pdf_report/Flexibility.jpg', 'Flexibility is the ability to move effectively through a complete range of motion in a joint. Flexibility is determined by the gender, age, training levels, temperature, and elasticity of the tissues surrounding a joint, namely, ligaments, tendons, and muscles. Improved flexibility allows for better performance when playing sports or exercising. It also adds to the level of comfort in day to day activities such as bending, walking, and lifting. The elasticity of the tissues involved is controlled by the protein collagen, providing the genetic linkage to flexibility.'),
(70, 'Fat loss response to exercise', 'images/pdf_report/Fatloss.jpg', 'Fat is stored in our body in the form of triglycerides in adipose tissues. During exercise, triglycerides are broken down into free fatty acids and transported to the muscles where they are oxidized to generate energy. This process leads to fat loss. Regular exercise renders weight control through oxidation of fats and improved metabolism. Losing fat helps in cultivating a positive body image and also leads to a decreased risk of health problems such as diabetes, heart diseases, arthritis, high blood pressure, and cancer. How efficiently people respond to exercise in terms of breaking down of triglycerides, transportation of free fatty acids, and subsequently, oxidation of these fatty acids depends on their genetics.'),
(71, 'Muscle Damage and Recovery', 'images/pdf_report/MuscleDamage.jpg', 'Exercise leads to muscle damage. While excessive muscle damage is detrimental, muscle damage to a small extent is essential for its growth and adaptation to the exercise stimuli. Muscle damage leads to an inflammatory response which repairs the muscle and aids in its growth and adaptation. This inflammation manifests itself as muscle soreness. Soreness is the feeling of pain and stiffness while using the muscle, thereby making day to day movements uncomfortable. Putting excessive stress on a sore muscle can lead to an injury. Therefore, it is imperative to understand an individual’s propensity for muscle damage after a workout and the rate of recovery from that damage, which would dictate the intensity of workouts and the ideal amount of rest that should be taken between two workouts. Interplay of many genes and the variations in them dictate the muscle damage and recovery response.'),
(72, 'Resistance training and muscle building', 'images/pdf_report/Resistancetraining.jpg', 'Skeletal muscles, being capable of generating force, are responsible for the movement of the body. Muscles are the primary engine room for fat burning and glucose uptake. Bigger muscles require more energy and in turn burn more calories, leading to fat loss and aiding in weight management. Muscles also help in preventing diabetes as they increase insulin sensitivity and hence protect against insulin resistance. Increasing muscle mass also leads to a more toned appearance, leading to a better body image and self confidence. Other benefits of increased muscle mass include decreased injury risk, increased immunity, increased strength and energy, decreased risk of arthritis and increased metabolic eficiency. Muscle building takes place by undertaking a weight training regimen along with proper caloric surplus diet high in protein. However, muscle mass building is governed by certain genes. An individual’s genetic profile can indicate how easily and to what extent a person can increase their muscle mass with training.');

123	Exercise Response	Resistance training and muscle building		BMP2	AC	The BMP2 gene encodes for a protein (bone morphogenetic protein 2 - BMP2) which among other functions influences the behavior of mesenchymal cells (cells that can differentiate into various cell types, including bone cells, muscle cells, fat cells, and cartilage cells). Since this protein influence the formation of muscle cells, its amount, timing, and location can influence myogenesis (formation of muscle tissue).		
124	Exercise Response	Resistance training and muscle building		IGFBP3	CC	The IGFBP3 gene encodes for a protein (insulin-like growth factor-binding protein 3), which exists in the skeletal muscles, binds to IGF1 or IGF2, enabling their function of regulating skeletal muscle growth. Most of the circulating IGF1 is bound by IGFBP-3 thus influencing the effects of IGF1 on skeletal muscles. Variation in the IGFBP3 gene has been known to influence the levels of IGFBP3 protein which in turn regulates the activity of IGF1.		
125	Exercise Response	Resistance training and muscle building		MSTN	GG, AA	The MSTN gene encodes for a protein (myostatin) which is found in muscles used for movement, plays a significant role in controlling the growth and development of tissues. It regulates the growth of muscles.		
126	Exercise Response	Resistance training and muscle building		IGF1	CT	The IGF1 gene encodes for a protein (insulin-like growth factor 1) which plays a key role in the growth and development of skeletal muscles, and can also induce hypertrophy (increased mass of a tissue due to an increase in cell size) of skeletal muscles.		
127	Exercise Response	Resistance training and muscle building		LEPR	AG	The LEPR gene encodes for a protein (leptin receptor) which is present in the hypothalamus along with other tissues including the skeletal muscles. The hormone, leptin, which binds to the receptor is believed to influence the uptake of glucose and fatty acid oxidation in skeletal muscles to prevent the accumulation of lipid (fat) in nonadipose tissues like skeletal muscles.		
128	Exercise Response	Resistance training and muscle building		 TRHR 	GG, TT	The TRHR gene encodes for a hormone receptor, which is the receptor to which the thyrotropic-releasing hormone (TRH) binds. The binding of TRH to the receptor results in various cellular signals which stimulate the thyroid gland to produce a hormone that is crucial in regulating the growth and development of skeletal muscles. Variation of this gene can interfere with the activity of TRH binding, which can further affect muscle-building post-training.		
129	Exercise Response	Resistance training and muscle building		 ACTN3	TT	The ACTN3 gene influences the production of a protein (α-actinin-3) found in fast-twitch muscle fibers, which are the kind of muscle fibers important for movement requiring power, such as weightlifting or sprinting. This protein plays a role in regulating muscle metabolism among other functions.		
130	Exercise Response	Resistance training and muscle building		INSIG-2	GG	This gene encodes for Insulin induced gene 2. It is an endoplasmic reticulum protein that blocks the processing of sterol regulatory element binding proteins (SREBPs) by binding to SREBP cleavage-activating protein (SCAP). It has been functionally linked to lipid metabolism, most notably due to its role in endogenous cholesterol and fatty acid synthesis feedback inhibition.		
131	Exercise Response	Resistance training and muscle building		ACE	GG	The ACE gene plays a role in the production of an enzyme (angiotensin II) which controls blood pressure. Certain variants of this gene can help in making better improvements during higher intensity training.		
132	Flexibility	Flexibility		ACTN3	TT	The ACTN3 gene influences the production of a protein (α-actinin-3) found in fast-twitch muscle fibers, which play a role in producing explosive muscle contractions. Along with the regulation of muscle strength, the ACTN3 gene also has an effect on flexibility and muscle stiffness. A variation of this gene has been shown to result in reduced flexibility.		
133	Flexibility	Flexibility		COL5A1	TT	The COL5A1 gene encodes for the protein (collagen type V α1 chain), which is found in ligaments, tendons, and other tissues containing type I collagen. This gene is known to affect skeletal muscle tissue and variations of this gene are found to influence muscle stiffness and joint flexibility.

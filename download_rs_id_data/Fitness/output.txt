rs7566605	(G;G)	0	common	rs7566605 was initially reported as being associated in at least 4 independent populations as being associated with obesity however replications are inconsistent, and a recent (2009) large meta-analysis comprising 34 studies (and over 70,000 subjects) has concluded that there is no evidence for overall association of the rs7566605 polymorphism with obesity.[PMID 19851442] See also: [PMID 16614226] Poster	At least one population has since been reported in which this association was not seen. [PMID 17218508] Furthermore, a study of 18,000 Danish subjects also failed to find any direct role for this SNP in the development of obesity, except that among physically inactive subjects, (C)-allele carriers tended to have a higher body mass index (by O.5 kg/m2) than (G)-allele carriers.[PMID 18682847]	On the other hand, a report has also been published indicating that obese children who are rs7566605(C;C) homozygotes find it harder to lose weight in clinical intervention programs than (C;G) heterozygotes or (G;G) homozygotes, which supports the association of SNP rs7566605 with obesity. [PMID 18003761]	[PMID 18570692] associated with the prevalence of hypercholesterolemia, but not with obesity, in Japanese American women. In Japanese American women, rs7566605(C;C) individuals had a 0.43-fold decreased risk (CI: 0.24 - 0.80) for hypercholesterolemia compared with the (G;G) homozygotes after adjustment for age and other factors. No significant differences in BMI, waist girth and percentage body fat according to the genotype in each of the four groups, which was divided by population and sex. The rs7566605(C;C) genotype is suggested to be a protective genetic factor against the progression of hypercholesterolemia on a high-fat diet, especially in Japanese female subjects.

rs1799945	(C;C)	0	Not a H63D hemochromatosis carrier.	rs1799945, also known as H63D or His63Asp, represents a SNP that accounts for a mild form of hereditary hemochromatosis (HH), an iron overload condition in which mutations of certain genes involved in iron metabolism disrupt the body’s ability to regulate uptake of iron, causing increased intestinal iron absorption. The most common form is caused by mutations in the HFE gene, which are inherited recessively. The gene for HH is closely linked to the HLA-A3 locus on the short arm of chromosome 6 [PMID 1278715]. In 1996, HFE, a gene for HH, was found to have two missense mutations [PMID 8696333]. A mutation at amino acid 282 (C282Y) was found to be homozygous in 83 percent of patients with HH. This is a point mutation from guanine to adenine, resulting in a missense mutation from cysteine to tyrosine. Such mutations are commonly found in people with European ancestry, and is more rare in Asian and African populations. Among individuals of northern European descent, hereditary hemochromatosis is the most common inherited identified genetic disorder. However, penetrance differs between different populations.	HH has four main pathophysiological mechanisms [PMID 21452290]: the increased absorption of dietary iron in the upper intestine, 2) decreased expression of hepcidin, 3) altered function of the HFE protein, and 4) tissue injury and fibrogenesis induced by iron. Since the HFE gene encodes for proteins that affect pathways centered around liver hepcidin synthesis, this mechanism will be further explained in more detail. The HFE gene regulates the liver protein hepcidin, which is considered to be the principal iron-regulatory hormone. Levels of hepcidin increase when iron levels increase in the blood, preventing intestinal cells and macrophages from releasing iron into the bloodstream. When iron builds up in the cells, signals are produced to reduce the iron absorption from food. Hepcidin levels decrease when the body needs more iron. Mutations in the HFE gene such as C282Y and H63D decrease hepcidin levels, causing intestinal cells to think more iron is needed. Thus, more iron is absorbed. Concentrations of hepcidin in the urine negatively correlate with the severity of HH.

rs1799945	(C;G)	3	One copy of H63D, carrier of hemochromatosis, likely unaffected unless also C282Y carrier.	rs1799945, also known as H63D or His63Asp, represents a SNP that accounts for a mild form of hereditary hemochromatosis (HH), an iron overload condition in which mutations of certain genes involved in iron metabolism disrupt the body’s ability to regulate uptake of iron, causing increased intestinal iron absorption. The most common form is caused by mutations in the HFE gene, which are inherited recessively. The gene for HH is closely linked to the HLA-A3 locus on the short arm of chromosome 6 [PMID 1278715]. In 1996, HFE, a gene for HH, was found to have two missense mutations [PMID 8696333]. A mutation at amino acid 282 (C282Y) was found to be homozygous in 83 percent of patients with HH. This is a point mutation from guanine to adenine, resulting in a missense mutation from cysteine to tyrosine. Such mutations are commonly found in people with European ancestry, and is more rare in Asian and African populations. Among individuals of northern European descent, hereditary hemochromatosis is the most common inherited identified genetic disorder. However, penetrance differs between different populations.	HH has four main pathophysiological mechanisms [PMID 21452290]: the increased absorption of dietary iron in the upper intestine, 2) decreased expression of hepcidin, 3) altered function of the HFE protein, and 4) tissue injury and fibrogenesis induced by iron. Since the HFE gene encodes for proteins that affect pathways centered around liver hepcidin synthesis, this mechanism will be further explained in more detail. The HFE gene regulates the liver protein hepcidin, which is considered to be the principal iron-regulatory hormone. Levels of hepcidin increase when iron levels increase in the blood, preventing intestinal cells and macrophages from releasing iron into the bloodstream. When iron builds up in the cells, signals are produced to reduce the iron absorption from food. Hepcidin levels decrease when the body needs more iron. Mutations in the HFE gene such as C282Y and H63D decrease hepcidin levels, causing intestinal cells to think more iron is needed. Thus, more iron is absorbed. Concentrations of hepcidin in the urine negatively correlate with the severity of HH.

rs1801133	(C;C)	0	Common genotype: normal homocysteine levels	PubMed lists over 3,000 studies linking rs1801133 to a long list of disorders in various populations across the world, of which only some are mentioned above. Considering the central role of MTHFR in folate metabolism and in control of homocysteine levels this is not surprising. A nice summary of the pathological significance of elevated homocysteine levels could be found in this article. However, despite the evidence that folic acid and other vitamins can reduce homocysteine levels, a review of 8 clinical trials concluded that the supplements provided no benefit in terms of decreasing blood clots, heart disease, cancer or overall mortality.[PMID 21069462]	With regard to gastric cancer, a meta-analysis combining 16 studies and ~2,700 patients concluded that the increased risk (odds ratio) associated with rs1801133 (T;T) and (C;T) genotypes, was 1.52 (CI 1.31-1.77) and 1.17 (CI 0.99-1.39), respectively, compared to the (C;C) genotype. Roughly the same risks were seen for Caucasians and Asians. Smoking and having low folate levels (presumably from diets low in fruits and veggies) increased the risk for (T;T) individuals from ~1.5x to ~2x, whereas having high folate levels almost reduced the risk for (T;T) genotypes pretty much down to the (C;C) level, ie. the average risk. [PMID 18162478]	Another meta-analysis of three studies on rs1801133 stratified according to dietary folate intake showed an increased risk for individuals with low folate intake (OR=1.37, CI: 0.92-2.06 for head and neck cancer and OR=1.28, CI: 0.97-1.68 for lung) versus high folate intake (OR=0.85, CI: 0.63-1.16 for head and neck cancer, and OR=0.94, CI: 0.79-1.12 for lung).[PMID 18789576]	rs1801131 and rs1801133 have been linked to increased risk for several types of brain cancer. The highest risk of meningioma was associated with heterozygosity for both MTHFR SNPs (odds ratio 2.11, CI: 1.42-3.12, p=0.002). The corresponding odds ratio for glioma was 1.23 (CI: 0.91-1.66, p=0.02. In general, risks were increased with genotypes associated with reduced MTHFR activity.[PMID 18483342]	Based on a study of 25,000 Caucasian women followed for 11 years (on average), the rs1801133(T;T) genotype individual was less likely to have migraine with aura (odds ratio 0.79, CI: 0.65-0.9 6, p = 0.02) and did not have increased risk for cardiovascular disease. However, if a (T;T) genotype did have migraine with aura, then the risk for cardiovascular disease was increased 3.66 fold (CI: 1.69-7.90, p = 0.001). This was apparently driven by a 4x increased risk for ischemic stroke (multivariable-adjusted relative risk 4.19, CI: 1.38-12.74, p = 0.01).[PMID 18672474]	A study of 677 patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) concluded that the adjusted hazard ratio for mortality in all patients was 2.27 (CI: 1.07 - 4.84, p = 0.03) for rs1801133(T;T) homozygotes, in other words, they died at about twice the rate of the other 2 genotypes over the time course of this study.[PMID 19272686]	In a case-control study of 152 cases (men) and 304 age-matched healthy controls conducted in one geographical area of Iran, evidence was seen that the MTHFR polymorphisms might contribute to increased clear cell renal cell carcinoma (CCRCC) risk in men. After controlling for confounding factors, a significant increase in CCRCC risk was found among carriers of the 677CT genotype compared with those with the 677CC genotype (odds ratio 2.21, 95% confidence interval 1.31-3.76), with a significant trend (P=0.014). Statistically significant odds ratios were also found in patients homozygous for MTHFR C677T, who have a 1.58-fold higher risk of developing CCRCC (95% confidence interval=1.21-2.44; P=0.024). Compared with the MTHFR 677CC genotype, the odds ratio (95% confidence interval) for the MTHFR 677TT genotype was 6.18 (95% confidence interval=4.75-8.34) for stage IV cancer and 4.68 (95% confidence interval=2.72-6.54) for grade 3 CCRCC (both P=0.0001). Clin Oncol (R Coll Radiol). 2012 May;24(4):269-81. doi: 10.1016/j.clon.2011.03.005. Epub 2011 Apr 13. [PMID 21489764]	[PMID 19648163] A 2-year follow-up study of 122 newly diagnosed patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) found that carriers of a rs1801133(T) allele were at increased risk for hepatic toxicity from methotrexate treatment. Hepatic toxicity was increased ~2x and ~5x for heterozygous and homozygous rs1801133(T) genotypes, respectively (p=0.028). If a carrier of a rs1801133(T) allele was also a carrier of a rs70991108 deletion allele, the risk for hepatic toxicity was even higher (odds ratio 6.8, p=0.018).

rs1801133	(C;T)	2.2	1 copy of C677T allele of MTHFR = 65% efficiency in processing folic acid	PubMed lists over 3,000 studies linking rs1801133 to a long list of disorders in various populations across the world, of which only some are mentioned above. Considering the central role of MTHFR in folate metabolism and in control of homocysteine levels this is not surprising. A nice summary of the pathological significance of elevated homocysteine levels could be found in this article. However, despite the evidence that folic acid and other vitamins can reduce homocysteine levels, a review of 8 clinical trials concluded that the supplements provided no benefit in terms of decreasing blood clots, heart disease, cancer or overall mortality.[PMID 21069462]	With regard to gastric cancer, a meta-analysis combining 16 studies and ~2,700 patients concluded that the increased risk (odds ratio) associated with rs1801133 (T;T) and (C;T) genotypes, was 1.52 (CI 1.31-1.77) and 1.17 (CI 0.99-1.39), respectively, compared to the (C;C) genotype. Roughly the same risks were seen for Caucasians and Asians. Smoking and having low folate levels (presumably from diets low in fruits and veggies) increased the risk for (T;T) individuals from ~1.5x to ~2x, whereas having high folate levels almost reduced the risk for (T;T) genotypes pretty much down to the (C;C) level, ie. the average risk. [PMID 18162478]	Another meta-analysis of three studies on rs1801133 stratified according to dietary folate intake showed an increased risk for individuals with low folate intake (OR=1.37, CI: 0.92-2.06 for head and neck cancer and OR=1.28, CI: 0.97-1.68 for lung) versus high folate intake (OR=0.85, CI: 0.63-1.16 for head and neck cancer, and OR=0.94, CI: 0.79-1.12 for lung).[PMID 18789576]	rs1801131 and rs1801133 have been linked to increased risk for several types of brain cancer. The highest risk of meningioma was associated with heterozygosity for both MTHFR SNPs (odds ratio 2.11, CI: 1.42-3.12, p=0.002). The corresponding odds ratio for glioma was 1.23 (CI: 0.91-1.66, p=0.02. In general, risks were increased with genotypes associated with reduced MTHFR activity.[PMID 18483342]	Based on a study of 25,000 Caucasian women followed for 11 years (on average), the rs1801133(T;T) genotype individual was less likely to have migraine with aura (odds ratio 0.79, CI: 0.65-0.9 6, p = 0.02) and did not have increased risk for cardiovascular disease. However, if a (T;T) genotype did have migraine with aura, then the risk for cardiovascular disease was increased 3.66 fold (CI: 1.69-7.90, p = 0.001). This was apparently driven by a 4x increased risk for ischemic stroke (multivariable-adjusted relative risk 4.19, CI: 1.38-12.74, p = 0.01).[PMID 18672474]	A study of 677 patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) concluded that the adjusted hazard ratio for mortality in all patients was 2.27 (CI: 1.07 - 4.84, p = 0.03) for rs1801133(T;T) homozygotes, in other words, they died at about twice the rate of the other 2 genotypes over the time course of this study.[PMID 19272686]	In a case-control study of 152 cases (men) and 304 age-matched healthy controls conducted in one geographical area of Iran, evidence was seen that the MTHFR polymorphisms might contribute to increased clear cell renal cell carcinoma (CCRCC) risk in men. After controlling for confounding factors, a significant increase in CCRCC risk was found among carriers of the 677CT genotype compared with those with the 677CC genotype (odds ratio 2.21, 95% confidence interval 1.31-3.76), with a significant trend (P=0.014). Statistically significant odds ratios were also found in patients homozygous for MTHFR C677T, who have a 1.58-fold higher risk of developing CCRCC (95% confidence interval=1.21-2.44; P=0.024). Compared with the MTHFR 677CC genotype, the odds ratio (95% confidence interval) for the MTHFR 677TT genotype was 6.18 (95% confidence interval=4.75-8.34) for stage IV cancer and 4.68 (95% confidence interval=2.72-6.54) for grade 3 CCRCC (both P=0.0001).

If a carrier of a rs1801133(T) allele was also a carrier of a rs70991108 deletion allele, the risk for hepatic toxicity was even higher (odds ratio 6.8, p=0.018).

rs1801133	(T;T)	2.8	homozygous for C677T of MTHFR = 10-20% efficiency in processing folic acid = high homocysteine, low B12 and folate levels	PubMed lists over 3,000 studies linking rs1801133 to a long list of disorders in various populations across the world, of which only some are mentioned above. Considering the central role of MTHFR in folate metabolism and in control of homocysteine levels this is not surprising. A nice summary of the pathological significance of elevated homocysteine levels could be found in this article. However, despite the evidence that folic acid and other vitamins can reduce homocysteine levels, a review of 8 clinical trials concluded that the supplements provided no benefit in terms of decreasing blood clots, heart disease, cancer or overall mortality.[PMID 21069462]	With regard to gastric cancer, a meta-analysis combining 16 studies and ~2,700 patients concluded that the increased risk (odds ratio) associated with rs1801133 (T;T) and (C;T) genotypes, was 1.52 (CI 1.31-1.77) and 1.17 (CI 0.99-1.39), respectively, compared to the (C;C) genotype. Roughly the same risks were seen for Caucasians and Asians. Smoking and having low folate levels (presumably from diets low in fruits and veggies) increased the risk for (T;T) individuals from ~1.5x to ~2x, whereas having high folate levels almost reduced the risk for (T;T) genotypes pretty much down to the (C;C) level, ie. the average risk. [PMID 18162478]	Another meta-analysis of three studies on rs1801133 stratified according to dietary folate intake showed an increased risk for individuals with low folate intake (OR=1.37, CI: 0.92-2.06 for head and neck cancer and OR=1.28, CI: 0.97-1.68 for lung) versus high folate intake (OR=0.85, CI: 0.63-1.16 for head and neck cancer, and OR=0.94, CI: 0.79-1.12 for lung).[PMID 18789576]	rs1801131 and rs1801133 have been linked to increased risk for several types of brain cancer. The highest risk of meningioma was associated with heterozygosity for both MTHFR SNPs (odds ratio 2.11, CI: 1.42-3.12, p=0.002). The corresponding odds ratio for glioma was 1.23 (CI: 0.91-1.66, p=0.02. In general, risks were increased with genotypes associated with reduced MTHFR activity.[PMID 18483342]	Based on a study of 25,000 Caucasian women followed for 11 years (on average), the rs1801133(T;T) genotype individual was less likely to have migraine with aura (odds ratio 0.79, CI: 0.65-0.9 6, p = 0.02) and did not have increased risk for cardiovascular disease. However, if a (T;T) genotype did have migraine with aura, then the risk for cardiovascular disease was increased 3.66 fold (CI: 1.69-7.90, p = 0.001). This was apparently driven by a 4x increased risk for ischemic stroke (multivariable-adjusted relative risk 4.19, CI: 1.38-12.74, p = 0.01).[PMID 18672474]	A study of 677 patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) concluded that the adjusted hazard ratio for mortality in all patients was 2.27 (CI: 1.07 - 4.84, p = 0.03) for rs1801133(T;T) homozygotes, in other words, they died at about twice the rate of the other 2 genotypes over the time course of this study.[PMID 19272686]	In a case-control study of 152 cases (men) and 304 age-matched healthy controls conducted in one geographical area of Iran, evidence was seen that the MTHFR polymorphisms might contribute to increased clear cell renal cell carcinoma (CCRCC) risk in men. After controlling for confounding factors, a significant increase in CCRCC risk was found among carriers of the 677CT genotype compared with those with the 677CC genotype (odds ratio 2.21, 95% confidence interval 1.31-3.76), with a significant trend (P=0.014). Statistically significant odds ratios were also found in patients homozygous for MTHFR C677T, who have a 1.58-fold higher risk of developing CCRCC (95% confidence interval=1.21-2.44; P=0.024). Compared with the MTHFR 677CC genotype, the odds ratio (95% confidence interval) for the MTHFR 677TT genotype was 6.18 (95% confidence interval=4.75-8.34) for stage IV cancer and 4.68 (95% confidence interval=2.72-6.54) for grade 3 CCRCC (both P=0.0001).

Hepatic toxicity was increased ~2x and ~5x for heterozygous and homozygous rs1801133(T) genotypes, respectively (p=0.028). If a carrier of a rs1801133(T) allele was also a carrier of a rs70991108 deletion allele, the risk for hepatic toxicity was even higher (odds ratio 6.8, p=0.018).

rs1800795	(C;G)		complex; see details	It was first described in 1998, when it was shown that the rs1800795(C) allele produces less IL6 than the (G) allele, which supported the hypothesis that a protective genotype against systemic onset juvenile rheumatoid arthritis would be rs1800795(C;C), and indeed, few juvenile RA patients had that genotype.[PMID 9769329]	[PMID 18257935] rs1800797, rs1800796 and rs1800795 have been shown to affect both the transcription and secretion of IL-6, to symptomatic distal interphalangeal osteoarthritis based on 535 women. the G alleles of two promoter single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) G-597A and G-174C were more common among the subjects with symptomatic DIP OA than among those with no disease (p-values corrected for multiple testing 0.020 and 0.024). Also, the carriage of at least one G allele in these positions increased the risk of disease (p=0.006 and, p=0.008, respectively). Carrying a haplotype with the G allele in all three promoter SNPs increased the risk of symptomatic DIP OA more than four-fold (OR 4.45, p=0.001). Carriage of the G-G diplotype indicated an increased risk of both symmetrical DIP OA (OR 1.52 95% CI 1.01 to 2.28) and symptomatic DIP OA (OR 3.67 95% CI 1.50 to 9.00)	[PMID 18056967] Suggests that "healthy elderly individuals may have a proinflammatory profile playing as a downregulating factor for inducible Hsp70, particularly if -174 G/C-negative" and that therefore, a nutraceutical intervention (fermented papaya preparation 9 g/day) might be of benefit.

Also, the carriage of at least one G allele in these positions increased the risk of disease (p=0.006 and, p=0.008, respectively). Carrying a haplotype with the G allele in all three promoter SNPs increased the risk of symptomatic DIP OA more than four-fold (OR 4.45, p=0.001). Carriage of the G-G diplotype indicated an increased risk of both symmetrical DIP OA (OR 1.52 95% CI 1.01 to 2.28) and symptomatic DIP OA (OR 3.67 95% CI 1.50 to 9.00)	[PMID 18056967] Suggests that "healthy elderly individuals may have a proinflammatory profile playing as a downregulating factor for inducible Hsp70, particularly if -174 G/C-negative" and that therefore, a nutraceutical intervention (fermented papaya preparation 9 g/day) might be of benefit.

This may therefore indicate that regular inhalant use may be counter-productive in young asthma patients carrying one or especially two rs1042713(A) alleles.[PMID 19800676]	[PMID 18647184] Association between polymorphisms in the beta2-adrenoceptor gene and migraine in women	[PMID 19553224] Trp64Arg polymorphism in ADRB3 gene is associated with elite endurance performance	[PMID 19565482] Association of adrenergic receptor gene polymorphisms with different fibromyalgia syndrome domains	[PMID 20523301] Role of beta(2)-Adrenergic Receptor Polymorphisms on Body Weight and Body Composition Response to Energy Restriction in Obese Women: Preliminary Results	[PMID 20044476] Associations of polymorphisms of eight muscle- or metabolism-related genes with performance in Mount Olympus marathon runners	[PMID 21883537] ?(2) -Adrenergic Receptor Thr164Ile Polymorphism, Blood Pressure and Ischaemic Heart Disease in 66,750 Individuals	[PMID 15500681] Detecting imbalanced expression of SNP alleles by minisequencing on microarrays.

rs143383	(C;C)	0	normal risk for osteoarthritis	The risk allele T (+ 104T/C;rs143383) causes reduction of the GDF5 promoter sequence activity. Reduction of GDF5 in human cartilage of patients with OA by up to 27% has been observed [1]. This effect is influenced by a second SNP ( rs143384 , C/T ) in the same area. The C alleles of both SNPs form CpG dinucleotides. Demethylation of both SNP's increases GDF5 expression.[2] [PMID 21642387] "Expression of the osteoarthritis-associated gene GDF5 is modulated epigenetically by DNA methylation." Thus the authors conclude that epigenetic manipulation offers options in developing therapies for OA.

[PMID 17676627] is *not* a risk factor for osteoarthritis in Greek Caucasians	A subsequent study showed that the same risk allele, rs143383(T), was (somewhat) associated with osteoarthritis in European populations. The odds ratio was 1.10 for the allele, 1.28 for carrier status (p=0.03, p=0.004, respectively). The (T) allele appears to make less GDF5 protein, which eventually renders an individual somewhat more susceptible to osteoarthritis.[PMID 17616513]	A meta-analysis combining data from 11,000+ individuals as well as both European and Asian populations found strong evidence (p < 0.0004) confirming increased risk for osteoarthritis from the rs143383(T) allele. The best model is a dominant one, and the odds ratio reported is 1.21 in general and 1.48 for the dominant model.[PMID 18299287]	Another meta-analysis of 14 studies concluded that rs143383 did indeed show significant association with osteoarthritis, at least for knee osteoarthritis, and probably for hand and hip (but to a lesser degree).

rs143383	(T;T)	1.8	1.3x increased risk for osteoarthritis	The risk allele T (+ 104T/C;rs143383) causes reduction of the GDF5 promoter sequence activity. Reduction of GDF5 in human cartilage of patients with OA by up to 27% has been observed [1]. This effect is influenced by a second SNP ( rs143384 , C/T ) in the same area. The C alleles of both SNPs form CpG dinucleotides. Demethylation of both SNP's increases GDF5 expression.[2] [PMID 21642387] "Expression of the osteoarthritis-associated gene GDF5 is modulated epigenetically by DNA methylation." Thus the authors conclude that epigenetic manipulation offers options in developing therapies for OA.	[PMID 17384641] rs143383 showed significant association with hip osteoarthritis in two independent Japanese populations. It also showed association with knee osteoarthritis in Japanese and Chinese populations.	[PMID 17676627] is *not* a risk factor for osteoarthritis in Greek Caucasians	A subsequent study showed that the same risk allele, rs143383(T), was (somewhat) associated with osteoarthritis in European populations. The odds ratio was 1.10 for the allele, 1.28 for carrier status (p=0.03, p=0.004, respectively). The (T) allele appears to make less GDF5 protein, which eventually renders an individual somewhat more susceptible to osteoarthritis.[PMID 17616513]	A meta-analysis combining data from 11,000+ individuals as well as both European and Asian populations found strong evidence (p < 0.0004) confirming increased risk for osteoarthritis from the rs143383(T) allele. The best model is a dominant one, and the odds ratio reported is 1.21 in general and 1.48 for the dominant model.[PMID 18299287]	Another meta-analysis of 14 studies concluded that rs143383 did indeed show significant association with osteoarthritis, at least for knee osteoarthritis, and probably for hand and hip (but to a lesser degree). The effect size wasn't large, though (odds ratio 1.15, CI: 1.09-1.22, p = 9.4 x 10e-7).[PMID 19479880]	A haplotype of rs143383 and rs6060369 can be defined, which also links osteoarthritis to height since rs6060369 was linked to height in a study ultimately involving over 28,000 individuals.[PMID 18193045]	The Medpage article on this finding notes that rs143383 was previously shown to be associated with increased risk for osteoarthritis and in this recent study [PMID 18193045] it was significantly associated with shorter height in the initial scans, at p=2.70x10e-5.	Note that the authors of [PMID 18193045] refer to rs143383 in the opposite orientation compared to it's entry in dbSNP.	[PMID 18947434] A study of 338 Han Chinese children affected by congenital dysplasia of the hip revealed that rs143383(T) alleles conferred a 1.4x increased risk for the disorder, particularly in females (odds ratio 1.43, CI: 1.11 - 1.85, p = 0.0078).

rs4880	(C;T)	1.1	complex! see rs4880	There appears to be some conflict in the literature over the effect of this SNP. Having a valine at codon 16 is said to reduce enzyme activity [PMID 15864132], and thus lead to increased oxidative stress, yet in at least one study of the actual enzyme levels measured in people, SOD2 activity was 33% higher in (C;T) or (T;T) individuals compared to (C;C) individuals [PMID 16538174]. Regardless of how this resolves, several phenotypic associations have been reported for this SNP, including:	The C allele of rs4880 appears to be slightly associated with Alzheimer's disease.

rs4680	(A;A)	2.5	(worrier) advantage in memory and attention tasks	Roughly speaking, the predominant wisdom (known colloquially as the warrior/worrier hypothesis; summary at [PMID 17008817]) posits that people with Val alleles have increased COMT activity and lower prefrontal extracellular dopamine compared with those with the Met substitution. Val158 alleles may be associated with an advantage in the processing of aversive stimuli (warrior strategy), while Met158 alleles may be associated with an advantage in memory and attention tasks (worrier strategy). Under conditions of increased dopamine release (eg, stress), individuals with Val158 alleles may have improved dopaminergic transmission and better performance, while individuals with Met158 alleles may have less efficient neurotransmission and worse performance. Some evidence suggests that Val158 alleles are associated with schizophrenia, while Met158 alleles are associated with anxiety.	A study of 400 individuals reported that an increase in plasma total homocysteine (tHcy) of 10.4% (CI: 0.01-0.21, p=0.03) for associated with rs4680(A;A) homozygotes compared with rs4680(G;G) subjects. The (A;A) genotype was also more common, but statistically not that significantly, in venous thrombosis patients (OR 1.61, CI: 0.97-2.65], p=0.06) compared to control subjects.[PMID 18064318]	And from [PMID 15866551]:  "Adolescent cannabis use was associated with increased risk of schizophreniform disorder in adulthood among Val/Val (i.e. rs4680(G;G)) individuals (OR = 10.9, 95% CI: 2.2â€“54.1) and, to a lesser extent, among Met/Val individuals (rs4680(A;G)); OR = 2.5, 95% CI: .78 â€“ 8.2), but not among Met/Met (rs4680(A;A)) individuals (OR = 1.1, 95% CI: .21â€“5.4)."	In a study of 2 populations of breast cancer patients (2,000+ patients), increased risk was associated with rs4680(G;G) genotypes in both the Ontario [odds ratio 2.22, CI: 1.49-3.28] and Finland [OR 1.73, CI: 1.08-2.78] populations.[PMID 18194538]	[PMID 18704099] A study of 330 cocaine-dependent individuals, all of African descent, concluded that there was a slight (odds ratio 1.44, CI: 1.12-1.86, p = 0.014) association between the rs4680(A) allele, in other words the Met encoding allele, and cocaine dependence.	[PMID 18989660] A study of the antidepressant paroxetine found better response in Met/Met homozygotes, worse effects in Val/Val homozygotes and intermediate effects in heterozygotes. The effect became significant at the third week of treatment. Paroxetine daily dose was proportional to baseline severity, but did not influence outcome.	A meta-analysis of neuroimaging studies found a significant association between the COMT genotype and prefrontal activation; strong and opposing effects were found for executive cognition paradigms (favoring Met allele carriers) and emotional paradigms (favoring Val).[PMID 19417742]	[PMID 19071221] gray matter volume and interacts with rs2097603 related to extracellular dopamine	[PMID 19207030] rs6275/DRD2 and rs4680/COMT useful in predicting disease risk among schizophrenia patients	[PMID 19037200] rs4680(G;G) carriers deprived of sleep respond quite well to 2x 100mg modafinil in terms of improved vigor and well-being, and maintained baseline performance with respect to executive functioning, whereas rs4680(A;A) individuals barely responded to the drug at all.

rs4680	(A;G)		Intermediate dopamine levels, other effects	Roughly speaking, the predominant wisdom (known colloquially as the warrior/worrier hypothesis; summary at [PMID 17008817]) posits that people with Val alleles have increased COMT activity and lower prefrontal extracellular dopamine compared with those with the Met substitution. Val158 alleles may be associated with an advantage in the processing of aversive stimuli (warrior strategy), while Met158 alleles may be associated with an advantage in memory and attention tasks (worrier strategy). Under conditions of increased dopamine release (eg, stress), individuals with Val158 alleles may have improved dopaminergic transmission and better performance, while individuals with Met158 alleles may have less efficient neurotransmission and worse performance. Some evidence suggests that Val158 alleles are associated with schizophrenia, while Met158 alleles are associated with anxiety.	A study of 400 individuals reported that an increase in plasma total homocysteine (tHcy) of 10.4% (CI: 0.01-0.21, p=0.03) for associated with rs4680(A;A) homozygotes compared with rs4680(G;G) subjects. The (A;A) genotype was also more common, but statistically not that significantly, in venous thrombosis patients (OR 1.61, CI: 0.97-2.65], p=0.06) compared to control subjects.[PMID 18064318]	And from [PMID 15866551]:  "Adolescent cannabis use was associated with increased risk of schizophreniform disorder in adulthood among Val/Val (i.e. rs4680(G;G)) individuals (OR = 10.9, 95% CI: 2.2â€“54.1) and, to a lesser extent, among Met/Val individuals (rs4680(A;G)); OR = 2.5, 95% CI: .78 â€“ 8.2), but not among Met/Met (rs4680(A;A)) individuals (OR = 1.1, 95% CI: .21â€“5.4)."	In a study of 2 populations of breast cancer patients (2,000+ patients), increased risk was associated with rs4680(G;G) genotypes in both the Ontario [odds ratio 2.22, CI: 1.49-3.28] and Finland [OR 1.73, CI: 1.08-2.78] populations.[PMID 18194538]	[PMID 18704099] A study of 330 cocaine-dependent individuals, all of African descent, concluded that there was a slight (odds ratio 1.44, CI: 1.12-1.86, p = 0.014) association between the rs4680(A) allele, in other words the Met encoding allele, and cocaine dependence.	[PMID 18989660] A study of the antidepressant paroxetine found better response in Met/Met homozygotes, worse effects in Val/Val homozygotes and intermediate effects in heterozygotes. The effect became significant at the third week of treatment. Paroxetine daily dose was proportional to baseline severity, but did not influence outcome.	A meta-analysis of neuroimaging studies found a significant association between the COMT genotype and prefrontal activation; strong and opposing effects were found for executive cognition paradigms (favoring Met allele carriers) and emotional paradigms (favoring Val).[PMID 19417742]	[PMID 19071221] gray matter volume and interacts with rs2097603 related to extracellular dopamine	[PMID 19207030] rs6275/DRD2 and rs4680/COMT useful in predicting disease risk among schizophrenia patients	[PMID 19037200] rs4680(G;G) carriers deprived of sleep respond quite well to 2x 100mg modafinil in terms of improved vigor and well-being, and maintained baseline performance with respect to executive functioning, whereas rs4680(A;A) individuals barely responded to the drug at all.	[PMID 16878403] Met158 allele carriers had "a more focused response...during a working memory task." "The met158 allele seems to be beneficial during the performance of working memory and attention-related tasks, whereas the val158 allele appears to be advantageous during the processing of aversive emotional stimuli."	[PMID 15673663] "Increased limbic and prefrontal activation elicited by unpleasant stimuli in subjects with more met158 alleles might contribute to the observed lower emotional resilience against negative mood states."	[PMID 12595695] In response to pain Met/Met allele carriers showed greater "sensory and affective ratings of pain and a more negative internal affective state. Opposite effects were observed in val158 homozygotes. The COMT val158met polymorphism thus influences the human experience of pain and may underlie interindividual differences in the adaptation and responses to pain and other stressful stimuli."

rs4680	(G;G)	2.5	(warrior) multiple associations, see details	Roughly speaking, the predominant wisdom (known colloquially as the warrior/worrier hypothesis; summary at [PMID 17008817]) posits that people with Val alleles have increased COMT activity and lower prefrontal extracellular dopamine compared with those with the Met substitution. Val158 alleles may be associated with an advantage in the processing of aversive stimuli (warrior strategy), while Met158 alleles may be associated with an advantage in memory and attention tasks (worrier strategy). Under conditions of increased dopamine release (eg, stress), individuals with Val158 alleles may have improved dopaminergic transmission and better performance, while individuals with Met158 alleles may have less efficient neurotransmission and worse performance. Some evidence suggests that Val158 alleles are associated with schizophrenia, while Met158 alleles are associated with anxiety.	A study of 400 individuals reported that an increase in plasma total homocysteine (tHcy) of 10.4% (CI: 0.01-0.21, p=0.03) for associated with rs4680(A;A) homozygotes compared with rs4680(G;G) subjects. The (A;A) genotype was also more common, but statistically not that significantly, in venous thrombosis patients (OR 1.61, CI: 0.97-2.65], p=0.06) compared to control subjects.[PMID 18064318]	And from [PMID 15866551]:  "Adolescent cannabis use was associated with increased risk of schizophreniform disorder in adulthood among Val/Val (i.e. rs4680(G;G)) individuals (OR = 10.9, 95% CI: 2.2â€“54.1) and, to a lesser extent, among Met/Val individuals (rs4680(A;G)); OR = 2.5, 95% CI: .78 â€“ 8.2), but not among Met/Met (rs4680(A;A)) individuals (OR = 1.1, 95% CI: .21â€“5.4)."	In a study of 2 populations of breast cancer patients (2,000+ patients), increased risk was associated with rs4680(G;G) genotypes in both the Ontario [odds ratio 2.22, CI: 1.49-3.28] and Finland [OR 1.73, CI: 1.08-2.78] populations.[PMID 18194538]	[PMID 18704099] A study of 330 cocaine-dependent individuals, all of African descent, concluded that there was a slight (odds ratio 1.44, CI: 1.12-1.86, p = 0.014) association between the rs4680(A) allele, in other words the Met encoding allele, and cocaine dependence.	[PMID 18989660] A study of the antidepressant paroxetine found better response in Met/Met homozygotes, worse effects in Val/Val homozygotes and intermediate effects in heterozygotes. The effect became significant at the third week of treatment. Paroxetine daily dose was proportional to baseline severity, but did not influence outcome.	A meta-analysis of neuroimaging studies found a significant association between the COMT genotype and prefrontal activation; strong and opposing effects were found for executive cognition paradigms (favoring Met allele carriers) and emotional paradigms (favoring Val).[PMID 19417742]	[PMID 19071221] gray matter volume and interacts with rs2097603 related to extracellular dopamine	[PMID 19207030] rs6275/DRD2 and rs4680/COMT useful in predicting disease risk among schizophrenia patients	[PMID 19037200] rs4680(G;G) carriers deprived of sleep respond quite well to 2x 100mg modafinil in terms of improved vigor and well-being, and maintained baseline performance with respect to executive functioning, whereas rs4680(A;A) individuals barely responded to the drug at all.	[PMID 16878403] Met158 allele carriers had "a more focused response...during a working memory task." "The met158 allele seems to be beneficial during the performance of working memory and attention-related tasks, whereas the val158 allele appears to be advantageous during the processing of aversive emotional stimuli."	[PMID 15673663] "Increased limbic and prefrontal activation elicited by unpleasant stimuli in subjects with more met158 alleles might contribute to the observed lower emotional resilience against negative mood states."	[PMID 12595695] In response to pain Met/Met allele carriers showed greater "sensory and affective ratings of pain and a more negative internal affective state. Opposite effects were observed in val158 homozygotes. The COMT val158met polymorphism thus influences the human experience of pain and may underlie interindividual differences in the adaptation and responses to pain and other stressful stimuli."

rs9939609	(A;T)	2.4	1.3x risk for T2D; obesity risk	rs9939609 is a SNP in the fat mass and obesity associated FTO gene, aka the "Fat Gene" [1]. The original paper describing it is here [PMID 17434869].	rs9939609 has also been reported in a large study to be associated with type-2 diabetes.The risk allele (oriented to the dbSNP entry) is (A); the odds ratio associated with heterozygotes is 1.34 (CI 1.17-1.52), and for homozygotes, 1.55 (CI 1.3-1.84). [PMID 17554300]	In a different study, this SNP was found in a linkage block in the FTO gene with rs1121980; see rs1121980 for the association of this block with early onset obesity since it showed the strongest association.[PMID 18159244]	The increases in body mass index associated with rs9939609(A) carriers appears to begin at a young age and are maintained throughout adulthood, according to a study of 5,600+ Utah families.[PMID 18239580]	This SNP did not show any association with obesity, type-2 diabetes or any other related traits in a study of 3,210 Chinese subjects.

[PMID 18379722] This SNP is also associated with (severe) obesity in a study of 927 Japanese patients.	[PMID 18948966] This SNP may contribute to variation in plasma C-reactive protein (CRP) levels independently of obesity; average CRP levels may be 12-14% higher per rs9939609(A) allele.	[PMID 18719664] This SNP is also associated with adult obesity in Mexicans.	[PMID 19158205] A longitudinal study of Finnish children concluded that the effect of rs9939609 on BMI only becomes evident after age 7, and that the FTO gene is not directly associated with energy intake or physical activity.

Similar results were observed for rs8050136. may confer a modest susceptibility to obesity in an ethnicity-specific manner, but may be unlikely to contribute to a clinically significant diabetes risk.	[PMID 28381478] A small study (less than 700 women, divided into 4+ groups) concluded that over 3 & 6 months women in a weight-loss program who were informed they carried at least one rs9939609 risk allele lost slightly more weight than non-carriers.

rs9939609	(T;T)	1.5	lower risk of obesity and Type-2 diabetes	rs9939609 is a SNP in the fat mass and obesity associated FTO gene, aka the "Fat Gene" [1]. The original paper describing it is here [PMID 17434869].	rs9939609 has also been reported in a large study to be associated with type-2 diabetes.The risk allele (oriented to the dbSNP entry) is (A); the odds ratio associated with heterozygotes is 1.34 (CI 1.17-1.52), and for homozygotes, 1.55 (CI 1.3-1.84). [PMID 17554300]	In a different study, this SNP was found in a linkage block in the FTO gene with rs1121980; see rs1121980 for the association of this block with early onset obesity since it showed the strongest association.[PMID 18159244]	The increases in body mass index associated with rs9939609(A) carriers appears to begin at a young age and are maintained throughout adulthood, according to a study of 5,600+ Utah families.[PMID 18239580]	This SNP did not show any association with obesity, type-2 diabetes or any other related traits in a study of 3,210 Chinese subjects.

rs671	(A;A)	4	Asian Flusher; increased risk of esophageal cancer; East Asian ancestry; Disulfiram not effective for alcoholism.	rs671 is a classic SNP, well known in a sense through the phenomena known as the "alcohol flush", also known as the "Asian Flush" or "Asian blush", in which certain individuals, often of Asian descent, have their face, neck and sometimes shoulders turn red after drinking alcohol.[PMID 6582480]	The rs671(A) allele of the ALDH2 gene is the culprit, in that it encodes a form of the aldehyde dehydrogenase 2 protein that is defective at metabolizing alcohol. This allele is known as the ALDH*2 form, and individuals possessing either one or two copies of it show alcohol-related sensitivity responses including facial flushing, and severe hangovers (and hence they are usually not regular drinkers). Perhaps not surprisingly they appear to suffer less from alcoholism and alcohol-related liver disease.

rs671	(A;G)	3.5	Asian Flush; worse hangovers; increased risk of esophageal cancer; East Asian ancestry; Disulfiram probably not effective for alcoholism.	rs671 is a classic SNP, well known in a sense through the phenomena known as the "alcohol flush", also known as the "Asian Flush" or "Asian blush", in which certain individuals, often of Asian descent, have their face, neck and sometimes shoulders turn red after drinking alcohol.[PMID 6582480]	The rs671(A) allele of the ALDH2 gene is the culprit, in that it encodes a form of the aldehyde dehydrogenase 2 protein that is defective at metabolizing alcohol. This allele is known as the ALDH*2 form, and individuals possessing either one or two copies of it show alcohol-related sensitivity responses including facial flushing, and severe hangovers (and hence they are usually not regular drinkers). Perhaps not surprisingly they appear to suffer less from alcoholism and alcohol-related liver disease.

rs2464196	(T;T)	2	~2x increased lung cancer risk	A large study pooling data from 3 Finnish studies totaling over 18,000 individuals concluded that while this SNP is not likely to be causative (relative to cancer), it and one other CRP SNP (rs1169300) are associated with increased risk for lung cancer. The odds ratio for minor alleles of either SNP was about 1.5x and 2x for heterozygotes and homozygotes, respectively. One other CRP SNP (rs1892534) was associated with increased overall cancer risk.

The risk T allele was associated with impaired insulin secretion, incretin effects, and enhanced rate of hepatic glucose production. TCF7L2 expression in human islets was increased 5-fold in T2D, particularly in carriers of the TT genotype.	This SNP is one of 4 relatively common SNPs reported to represent risk for type-2 diabetes in the DESIR prospective study of 3,877 Caucasian participants. Under an additive model, the odds ratio for the (T) risk allele is 1.45 (CI: 1.2-1.77, p=0.0002).

This SNP is one of 4 relatively common SNPs reported to represent risk for type-2 diabetes in the DESIR prospective study of 3,877 Caucasian participants. Under an additive model, the odds ratio for the (T) risk allele is 1.45 (CI: 1.2-1.77, p=0.0002).

The risk T allele was associated with impaired insulin secretion, incretin effects, and enhanced rate of hepatic glucose production. TCF7L2 expression in human islets was increased 5-fold in T2D, particularly in carriers of the TT genotype.	This SNP is one of 4 relatively common SNPs reported to represent risk for type-2 diabetes in the DESIR prospective study of 3,877 Caucasian participants. Under an additive model, the odds ratio for the (T) risk allele is 1.45 (CI: 1.2-1.77, p=0.0002).

rs662	(A;A)	2	~2x higher risk of of coronary heart disease reported in some studies, but lower risk seen in other studies	rs662, also known as Q192R, is a SNP in the PON1 gene.  It codes for amino acid 192 of the paraoxonase (PON) protein.  Variants of this SNP affect PON catalytic efficiency and are correlated with Heart disease and trait-anxiety scores.  The normal form, rs662(A), encodes a glutamine (Q), while the variant, rs662(G), encodes an arginine (R). The general hypothesis is that the glutamine-containing PON1 protein has higher enzymatic activity, leading to lower risk for heart disease.[PMID 8675673]. However, there are publications that clearly report the opposite.

The high trait-anxiety group included "significantly more subjects homozygous to the Alzheimer's disease- predictive PON192 variant."  The authors also cite another paper, [PMID 12525679], which found that this SNP affects PON's catalytic efficiency.

rs662	(G;G)	1.3	Mixed; conflicting results reported related to stroke and CAD	rs662, also known as Q192R, is a SNP in the PON1 gene.  It codes for amino acid 192 of the paraoxonase (PON) protein.  Variants of this SNP affect PON catalytic efficiency and are correlated with Heart disease and trait-anxiety scores.  The normal form, rs662(A), encodes a glutamine (Q), while the variant, rs662(G), encodes an arginine (R). The general hypothesis is that the glutamine-containing PON1 protein has higher enzymatic activity, leading to lower risk for heart disease.[PMID 8675673]. However, there are publications that clearly report the opposite.	[PMID 18708400] 274 ovarian epithelial carcinoma cases and 452 controls. rs662 odds ratio 0.65 (CI: 0.44-0.95; p for allele-dose effect = 0.03) for ovarian cancer for women carrying the rs662(A) allele compared with women with the (G;G) genotype	[PMID 19263529] rs1799864(G), rs3025058(A) and rs662(G) were associated with increased risk, and rs1800775(A) with reduced risk of recurrent venous thromboembolism	[PMID 15060281)] In a study of 461 participants in the HERITAGE cohort (172 African-American, 289 Caucasian), the combination of rs662 with rs854560 was found to significantly contribute to trait-anxiety scores.  The high trait-anxiety group included "significantly more subjects homozygous to the Alzheimer's disease- predictive PON192 variant."  The authors also cite another paper, [PMID 12525679], which found that this SNP affects PON's catalytic efficiency.  From the context, it appears that it is the "R" variant, or rs662(G), which corresponds to the higher trait-anxiety scores and reduced catalytic efficiency, though this is less explicitly stated than one might hope.

rs4961	(G;T)	2	1.8x increased risk for high blood pressure	Originally, a study of 477 Italian patients indicated that carriers of one or two rs4961(T) alleles were at 1.8x increased risk for hypertension (CI: 1.32-2.43). This study also indicated that carriers of the risk (T) allele responded better to diuretics and sodium-restricted diets, in that they tended to lower their blood pressure by ~10 mmHg points compared to rs4961(G;G) homozygotes similarly treated.[PMID 9149697]	In a study of ~2200 Belgian patients, rs4961(T) carriers were generally at 2-3 fold higher rik for cardiovascular mortality and morbidity.[PMID 16043664]	In a study of ~1000 hypertensives followed for 10 years, rs4961(T) carriers responded better to low-dose diuretic therapy, as seen by a lower (almost halved) risk of combined myocardial infarction or stroke than if other antihypertensive therapies were used to achieve the same reduction in blood pressure.[PMID 11926892]	A SNP in another adducin gene, adducin 3 ADD3, may modify the risk of carrying an rs4961 risk allele.

rs1800469	(C;C)	1	lower TGF-β1 levels, higher risk for COPD?	rs1800469, also known as -509 C>T, C509T or −1347 C>T, is an SNP in the promoter region of the transforming growth factor beta1 TGFB1 gene. That means it doesn't change the nature of the TGF-β1 protein, but it does change the amount produced. The T version increases the amount of TGF-β1 produced, by preventing AP1 from binding to this region where in the C version it would normally downregulate production. That increased TGF-β1 production with the T version is probably what causes all the health effects of this SNP.

rs1800469	(C;T)	1	slightly higher TGF-β1 levels, higher risk for COPD?	rs1800469, also known as -509 C>T, C509T or −1347 C>T, is an SNP in the promoter region of the transforming growth factor beta1 TGFB1 gene. That means it doesn't change the nature of the TGF-β1 protein, but it does change the amount produced. The T version increases the amount of TGF-β1 produced, by preventing AP1 from binding to this region where in the C version it would normally downregulate production. That increased TGF-β1 production with the T version is probably what causes all the health effects of this SNP. [PMID 16896927] Whether increased TGF-β1 is good or bad probably depends on the disease you are interested in.

rs1800469	(T;T)	1	higher TGF-β1 levels	rs1800469, also known as -509 C>T, C509T or −1347 C>T, is an SNP in the promoter region of the transforming growth factor beta1 TGFB1 gene. That means it doesn't change the nature of the TGF-β1 protein, but it does change the amount produced. The T version increases the amount of TGF-β1 produced, by preventing AP1 from binding to this region where in the C version it would normally downregulate production. That increased TGF-β1 production with the T version is probably what causes all the health effects of this SNP. [PMID 16896927] Whether increased TGF-β1 is good or bad probably depends on the disease you are interested in.	It has been associated with increased risk for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Although smoking is the main risk factor, smokers with a rs1800469(C) allele (or 2 other TGFB1 SNPs, rs1982073 and rs2241712) were more likely to develop COPD, based on a study of ~700 Caucasian subjects [PMID 15175276]	Although based on a relatively small number of patients, a 2018 study concluded that women with breast cancer receiving radiation who carry a rs1800469(T) allele are at ~4x higher risk of radiation-induced fibrosis (scarring) and related poor cosmetic outcomes compared to women who are rs1800469(C;C).[PMID 30027292]	{{PMID Auto|PMID=19258388|Title=Genetic variation in the transforming growth factor-{beta}1 gene is associated with susceptibility to IgA nephropathy|OA=1}}	[PMID 19380441] Single Nucleotide Polymorphism at rs1982073:T869C of the TGF{beta}1 Gene Is Associated With the Risk of Radiation Pneumonitis in Patients With Non-Small-Cell Lung Cancer Treated With Definitive Radiotherapy	[PMID 19559392] A candidate gene association study of 77 polymorphisms in migraine	[PMID 22053598] Association of TGF-beta1, IL-4 and IL-13 gene polymerphisms with asthma in a Chinese population	[PMID 22282866] The Effects of Functional Polymorphisms in the TGF?1 Gene on Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma Susceptibility	[PMID 22513132] Interaction between smoking and functional polymorphism in the TGFB1 gene is associated with ischaemic heart disease and myocardial infarction in patients with rheumatoid arthritis: a cross-sectional study	[PMID 22558067] Genes in the ureteric budding pathway: association study on vesico-ureteral reflux patients.

rs1042713	(A;A)	1.7	1.7x increased risk that pediatric inhaler use may make asthma worse	A study of 1,182 young Scottish asthma patients (age, 3-22 years) concluded that rs1042713(A) alleles are significantly associated with "exacerbations" of their condition, regardless of treatment regimens (odds ratio 1.30, CI: 1.09-1.55, p=0.003). This didn't hold true for patients using inhalers less than once per day; and it was particularly true for those receiving daily inhaled long- or short-acting beta(2)-agonist treatment (OR, 1.64, CI: 1.22-2.20, p=.001). This may therefore indicate that regular inhalant use may be counter-productive in young asthma patients carrying one or especially two rs1042713(A) alleles.[PMID 19800676]	[PMID 18647184] Association between polymorphisms in the beta2-adrenoceptor gene and migraine in women	[PMID 19553224] Trp64Arg polymorphism in ADRB3 gene is associated with elite endurance performance	[PMID 19565482] Association of adrenergic receptor gene polymorphisms with different fibromyalgia syndrome domains	[PMID 20523301] Role of beta(2)-Adrenergic Receptor Polymorphisms on Body Weight and Body Composition Response to Energy Restriction in Obese Women: Preliminary Results	[PMID 20044476] Associations of polymorphisms of eight muscle- or metabolism-related genes with performance in Mount Olympus marathon runners	[PMID 21883537] ?(2) -Adrenergic Receptor Thr164Ile Polymorphism, Blood Pressure and Ischaemic Heart Disease in 66,750 Individuals	[PMID 15500681] Detecting imbalanced expression of SNP alleles by minisequencing on microarrays.

rs1042713	(A;G)	1.3	1.3x increased risk that pediatric inhaler use may make asthma worse	A study of 1,182 young Scottish asthma patients (age, 3-22 years) concluded that rs1042713(A) alleles are significantly associated with "exacerbations" of their condition, regardless of treatment regimens (odds ratio 1.30, CI: 1.09-1.55, p=0.003). This didn't hold true for patients using inhalers less than once per day; and it was particularly true for those receiving daily inhaled long- or short-acting beta(2)-agonist treatment (OR, 1.64, CI: 1.22-2.20, p=.001). This may therefore indicate that regular inhalant use may be counter-productive in young asthma patients carrying one or especially two rs1042713(A) alleles.[PMID 19800676]	[PMID 18647184] Association between polymorphisms in the beta2-adrenoceptor gene and migraine in women	[PMID 19553224] Trp64Arg polymorphism in ADRB3 gene is associated with elite endurance performance	[PMID 19565482] Association of adrenergic receptor gene polymorphisms with different fibromyalgia syndrome domains	[PMID 20523301] Role of beta(2)-Adrenergic Receptor Polymorphisms on Body Weight and Body Composition Response to Energy Restriction in Obese Women: Preliminary Results	[PMID 20044476] Associations of polymorphisms of eight muscle- or metabolism-related genes with performance in Mount Olympus marathon runners	[PMID 21883537] ?(2) -Adrenergic Receptor Thr164Ile Polymorphism, Blood Pressure and Ischaemic Heart Disease in 66,750 Individuals	[PMID 15500681] Detecting imbalanced expression of SNP alleles by minisequencing on microarrays.

rs1024611	(C;T)	2	increased risk of exercise induced ischemia	In a study focusing on 679 apparently healthy siblings of people with premature heart disease, investigators found that carriers of an rs1024611(C) allele - oriented as in dbSNP, not as published - independently predicted the risk of exercise induced ischemia in general. The odds ratio was reported to be 1.86 (CI: 1.14-3.04, p=0.014), regardless of race, age, sex and other factors.

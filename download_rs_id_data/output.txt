rs1695	(A;A)	0	normal asthma risk in certain populations	Despite evidence of antioxidant effects of vitamin E in vitro and in animal studies, large, randomized clinical trials have not substantiated a benefit of vitamin E in reducing inflammation in humans. In healthy control subjects, the effect of α-tocopherol supplementation on the production of inflammatory cytokines appears to be dependent on an individual's genotype. These genotype-specific differences may help explain some of the discordant results in studies that used vitamin E. Persons having the alleles AA or AG had an increase in interleukin-6 (IL-6) upon supplementing alpha-tocopherol (the most common form of Vitamin E in a North American diet) while those with GG saw a decrease. [PMID 22572643]	Several papers published findings associating GSTP1 Ile105Val genotypes with bronchial, childhood, or atopic asthma. [PMID 15612961]	Note that some studies, however, have not observed any association between this SNP and asthma in certain populations [PMID 16176403], or even more paradoxically, have observed that rs1695(G;G) homozygotes appear to be somewhat protected (OR 0.29) from developing asthma compared to individuals with rs1695(A;G) or (A;A) genotypes. [PMID 14748821]	A cohort of 1,610 children in the US were studied to determine that the risk for new-onset asthma was highest in rs1695(A;A) homozygotes who participated in 3 or more sports in high-ozone communities. These children were at 6x higher risk (CI: 2.2-7.4). [PMID 18988661]	A study of 3,000 Chinese women with breast cancer concluded that rs1695(G;G) genotype was significantly associated with greater breast cancer risk, particularly in premenopausal women (odds ratio 1.69, CI: 1.17-2.43). The odds increased further if such women reported eating little cruciferous vegetables (then the odds ratio was 2.08, CI: 1.20-3.59).[PMID 18326615]	A relatively small study of 58 patients with different types of cancer receiving docetaxel concluded that rs1695(A;A) homozygotes (i.e. Ile105/Ile105 homozygotes) had a higher risk of developing docetaxel-induced peripheral neuropathy (DIPN), particularly grade 2 or higher.

rs4880	(C;C)	1.1	complex! see rs4880	There appears to be some conflict in the literature over the effect of this SNP. Having a valine at codon 16 is said to reduce enzyme activity [PMID 15864132], and thus lead to increased oxidative stress, yet in at least one study of the actual enzyme levels measured in people, SOD2 activity was 33% higher in (C;T) or (T;T) individuals compared to (C;C) individuals [PMID 16538174].

rs1800795	(C;G)		complex; see details	It was first described in 1998, when it was shown that the rs1800795(C) allele produces less IL6 than the (G) allele, which supported the hypothesis that a protective genotype against systemic onset juvenile rheumatoid arthritis would be rs1800795(C;C), and indeed, few juvenile RA patients had that genotype.[PMID 9769329]	[PMID 18257935] rs1800797, rs1800796 and rs1800795 have been shown to affect both the transcription and secretion of IL-6, to symptomatic distal interphalangeal osteoarthritis based on 535 women. the G alleles of two promoter single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) G-597A and G-174C were more common among the subjects with symptomatic DIP OA than among those with no disease (p-values corrected for multiple testing 0.020 and 0.024). Also, the carriage of at least one G allele in these positions increased the risk of disease (p=0.006 and, p=0.008, respectively). Carrying a haplotype with the G allele in all three promoter SNPs increased the risk of symptomatic DIP OA more than four-fold (OR 4.45, p=0.001). Carriage of the G-G diplotype indicated an increased risk of both symmetrical DIP OA (OR 1.52 95% CI 1.01 to 2.28) and symptomatic DIP OA (OR 3.67 95% CI 1.50 to 9.00)	[PMID 18056967] Suggests that "healthy elderly individuals may have a proinflammatory profile playing as a downregulating factor for inducible Hsp70, particularly if -174 G/C-negative" and that therefore, a nutraceutical intervention (fermented papaya preparation 9 g/day) might be of benefit.

Also, the carriage of at least one G allele in these positions increased the risk of disease (p=0.006 and, p=0.008, respectively). Carrying a haplotype with the G allele in all three promoter SNPs increased the risk of symptomatic DIP OA more than four-fold (OR 4.45, p=0.001). Carriage of the G-G diplotype indicated an increased risk of both symmetrical DIP OA (OR 1.52 95% CI 1.01 to 2.28) and symptomatic DIP OA (OR 3.67 95% CI 1.50 to 9.00)	[PMID 18056967] Suggests that "healthy elderly individuals may have a proinflammatory profile playing as a downregulating factor for inducible Hsp70, particularly if -174 G/C-negative" and that therefore, a nutraceutical intervention (fermented papaya preparation 9 g/day) might be of benefit.

rs1799945	(C;C)	0	Not a H63D hemochromatosis carrier.	rs1799945, also known as H63D or His63Asp, represents a SNP that accounts for a mild form of hereditary hemochromatosis (HH), an iron overload condition in which mutations of certain genes involved in iron metabolism disrupt the body’s ability to regulate uptake of iron, causing increased intestinal iron absorption. The most common form is caused by mutations in the HFE gene, which are inherited recessively. The gene for HH is closely linked to the HLA-A3 locus on the short arm of chromosome 6 [PMID 1278715]. In 1996, HFE, a gene for HH, was found to have two missense mutations [PMID 8696333]. A mutation at amino acid 282 (C282Y) was found to be homozygous in 83 percent of patients with HH. This is a point mutation from guanine to adenine, resulting in a missense mutation from cysteine to tyrosine. Such mutations are commonly found in people with European ancestry, and is more rare in Asian and African populations. Among individuals of northern European descent, hereditary hemochromatosis is the most common inherited identified genetic disorder. However, penetrance differs between different populations.	HH has four main pathophysiological mechanisms [PMID 21452290]: the increased absorption of dietary iron in the upper intestine, 2) decreased expression of hepcidin, 3) altered function of the HFE protein, and 4) tissue injury and fibrogenesis induced by iron. Since the HFE gene encodes for proteins that affect pathways centered around liver hepcidin synthesis, this mechanism will be further explained in more detail. The HFE gene regulates the liver protein hepcidin, which is considered to be the principal iron-regulatory hormone. Levels of hepcidin increase when iron levels increase in the blood, preventing intestinal cells and macrophages from releasing iron into the bloodstream. When iron builds up in the cells, signals are produced to reduce the iron absorption from food. Hepcidin levels decrease when the body needs more iron. Mutations in the HFE gene such as C282Y and H63D decrease hepcidin levels, causing intestinal cells to think more iron is needed. Thus, more iron is absorbed. Concentrations of hepcidin in the urine negatively correlate with the severity of HH.

Levels of hepcidin increase when iron levels increase in the blood, preventing intestinal cells and macrophages from releasing iron into the bloodstream. When iron builds up in the cells, signals are produced to reduce the iron absorption from food. Hepcidin levels decrease when the body needs more iron. Mutations in the HFE gene such as C282Y and H63D decrease hepcidin levels, causing intestinal cells to think more iron is needed. Thus, more iron is absorbed. Concentrations of hepcidin in the urine negatively correlate with the severity of HH.

rs1042713	(A;A)	1.7	1.7x increased risk that pediatric inhaler use may make asthma worse	A study of 1,182 young Scottish asthma patients (age, 3-22 years) concluded that rs1042713(A) alleles are significantly associated with "exacerbations" of their condition, regardless of treatment regimens (odds ratio 1.30, CI: 1.09-1.55, p=0.003).

rs1042713	(G;G)		normal	A study of 1,182 young Scottish asthma patients (age, 3-22 years) concluded that rs1042713(A) alleles are significantly associated with "exacerbations" of their condition, regardless of treatment regimens (odds ratio 1.30, CI: 1.09-1.55, p=0.003). This didn't hold true for patients using inhalers less than once per day; and it was particularly true for those receiving daily inhaled long- or short-acting beta(2)-agonist treatment (OR, 1.64, CI: 1.22-2.20, p=.001). This may therefore indicate that regular inhalant use may be counter-productive in young asthma patients carrying one or especially two rs1042713(A) alleles.[PMID 19800676]	[PMID 18647184] Association between polymorphisms in the beta2-adrenoceptor gene and migraine in women	[PMID 19553224] Trp64Arg polymorphism in ADRB3 gene is associated with elite endurance performance	[PMID 19565482] Association of adrenergic receptor gene polymorphisms with different fibromyalgia syndrome domains	[PMID 20523301] Role of beta(2)-Adrenergic Receptor Polymorphisms on Body Weight and Body Composition Response to Energy Restriction in Obese Women: Preliminary Results	[PMID 20044476] Associations of polymorphisms of eight muscle- or metabolism-related genes with performance in Mount Olympus marathon runners	[PMID 21883537] ?(2) -Adrenergic Receptor Thr164Ile Polymorphism, Blood Pressure and Ischaemic Heart Disease in 66,750 Individuals	[PMID 15500681] Detecting imbalanced expression of SNP alleles by minisequencing on microarrays.

GATA3 belongs to the GATA family of transcription factors.

A recent genome-wide association study (GWAS), using data from Colon Cancer Family Registry (CCFR) and the Genetics and Epidemiology of Colorectal Cancer Consortium (GECCO), discovered a strong correlation between rs4143094 and risk of colorectal cancer when ingesting red and processed meat [PMID 24743840]. In the study, approximately 2.7M SNPs were tested across 9,287 case and 9,117 control subjects, all with European ancestry.	The result shows that rs4143094 is associated with risk of colorectal cancer (P = 8.73e-9), with T being the risk allele. Specifically, individuals with TG and TT genotypes are increased for occurrence of colorectal cancer with odds ratio (OR) of 1.2 and 1.39, respectively. rs4143094 resides in a 9.5 kb linkage-disequilibrium (LD) block (r2 > 0.8) containing 19 highly correlated SNPs. The third most significant among these SNPs, rs1269486, is located 1420 bases upstream of GATA3 and is in a region of open chromatin (DNA hypersensitivity). Experimental evidence suggests binding activity of Pol2 and transcription factors c-Fos, JunD, and c-Jun in this region [PMID 23193274]. Many other SNPs in the LD block reside in GATA3-antisense RNA1 (GATA3-AS1).  GATA3-AS1 may regulate GATA3 transcript activity, although further experimental evidence is required.

rs9939609	(A;A)	3	obesity risk and 1.6x risk for T2D	rs9939609 is a SNP in the fat mass and obesity associated FTO gene, aka the "Fat Gene" [1]. The original paper describing it is here [PMID 17434869].	rs9939609 has also been reported in a large study to be associated with type-2 diabetes.The risk allele (oriented to the dbSNP entry) is (A); the odds ratio associated with heterozygotes is 1.34 (CI 1.17-1.52), and for homozygotes, 1.55 (CI 1.3-1.84). [PMID 17554300]	In a different study, this SNP was found in a linkage block in the FTO gene with rs1121980; see rs1121980 for the association of this block with early onset obesity since it showed the strongest association.[PMID 18159244]	The increases in body mass index associated with rs9939609(A) carriers appears to begin at a young age and are maintained throughout adulthood, according to a study of 5,600+ Utah families.[PMID 18239580]	This SNP did not show any association with obesity, type-2 diabetes or any other related traits in a study of 3,210 Chinese subjects.

rs9939609	(A;T)	2.4	1.3x risk for T2D; obesity risk	rs9939609 is a SNP in the fat mass and obesity associated FTO gene, aka the "Fat Gene" [1]. The original paper describing it is here [PMID 17434869].	rs9939609 has also been reported in a large study to be associated with type-2 diabetes.The risk allele (oriented to the dbSNP entry) is (A); the odds ratio associated with heterozygotes is 1.34 (CI 1.17-1.52), and for homozygotes, 1.55 (CI 1.3-1.84). [PMID 17554300]	In a different study, this SNP was found in a linkage block in the FTO gene with rs1121980; see rs1121980 for the association of this block with early onset obesity since it showed the strongest association.[PMID 18159244]	The increases in body mass index associated with rs9939609(A) carriers appears to begin at a young age and are maintained throughout adulthood, according to a study of 5,600+ Utah families.[PMID 18239580]	This SNP did not show any association with obesity, type-2 diabetes or any other related traits in a study of 3,210 Chinese subjects. Furthermore, the minor allele frequency was much lower in Chinese populations compared to populations of European descent.[PMID 17959933]	[PMID 18437351] 1,638 type 2 diabetes patients and 1,858 controls	[PMID 18583465] A study of 3,000+ UK children indicated that (A;A) genotypes were less satieted (i.e. had greater appetite) than other genotypes, indicating this risk allele for obesity is likely to influence appetite.	[PMID 18379722] This SNP is also associated with (severe) obesity in a study of 927 Japanese patients.	[PMID 18948966] This SNP may contribute to variation in plasma C-reactive protein (CRP) levels independently of obesity; average CRP levels may be 12-14% higher per rs9939609(A) allele.	[PMID 18719664] This SNP is also associated with adult obesity in Mexicans.	[PMID 19158205] A longitudinal study of Finnish children concluded that the effect of rs9939609 on BMI only becomes evident after age 7, and that the FTO gene is not directly associated with energy intake or physical activity.	[PMID 19214238] Independent of fatness, the A-allele of the FTO SNP appears to increase mortality of a magnitude similar to smoking, but without a particular underlying disease pattern barring an increase in the risk of diseases of the nervous system.	[PMID 18787525] Each copy of the risk-allele A at rs9939609 was significantly associated with 0.45 kg/m(2) increase in BMI (95% confidence interval (CI): 0.16-0.74; P = 0.004) and 0.97 cm increase in waist circumference (95% CI: 0.21-0.65; P = 0.0002). Similar results were observed for rs8050136. may confer a modest susceptibility to obesity in an ethnicity-specific manner, but may be unlikely to contribute to a clinically significant diabetes risk.	[PMID 28381478] A small study (less than 700 women, divided into 4+ groups) concluded that over 3 & 6 months women in a weight-loss program who were informed they carried at least one rs9939609 risk allele lost slightly more weight than non-carriers.

rs9939609	(T;T)	1.5	lower risk of obesity and Type-2 diabetes	rs9939609 is a SNP in the fat mass and obesity associated FTO gene, aka the "Fat Gene" [1]. The original paper describing it is here [PMID 17434869].	rs9939609 has also been reported in a large study to be associated with type-2 diabetes.The risk allele (oriented to the dbSNP entry) is (A); the odds ratio associated with heterozygotes is 1.34 (CI 1.17-1.52), and for homozygotes, 1.55 (CI 1.3-1.84). [PMID 17554300]	In a different study, this SNP was found in a linkage block in the FTO gene with rs1121980; see rs1121980 for the association of this block with early onset obesity since it showed the strongest association.[PMID 18159244]	The increases in body mass index associated with rs9939609(A) carriers appears to begin at a young age and are maintained throughout adulthood, according to a study of 5,600+ Utah families.[PMID 18239580]	This SNP did not show any association with obesity, type-2 diabetes or any other related traits in a study of 3,210 Chinese subjects. Furthermore, the minor allele frequency was much lower in Chinese populations compared to populations of European descent.[PMID 17959933]	[PMID 18437351] 1,638 type 2 diabetes patients and 1,858 controls	[PMID 18583465] A study of 3,000+ UK children indicated that (A;A) genotypes were less satieted (i.e. had greater appetite) than other genotypes, indicating this risk allele for obesity is likely to influence appetite.	[PMID 18379722] This SNP is also associated with (severe) obesity in a study of 927 Japanese patients.	[PMID 18948966] This SNP may contribute to variation in plasma C-reactive protein (CRP) levels independently of obesity; average CRP levels may be 12-14% higher per rs9939609(A) allele.	[PMID 18719664] This SNP is also associated with adult obesity in Mexicans.	[PMID 19158205] A longitudinal study of Finnish children concluded that the effect of rs9939609 on BMI only becomes evident after age 7, and that the FTO gene is not directly associated with energy intake or physical activity.	[PMID 19214238] Independent of fatness, the A-allele of the FTO SNP appears to increase mortality of a magnitude similar to smoking, but without a particular underlying disease pattern barring an increase in the risk of diseases of the nervous system.	[PMID 18787525] Each copy of the risk-allele A at rs9939609 was significantly associated with 0.45 kg/m(2) increase in BMI (95% confidence interval (CI): 0.16-0.74; P = 0.004) and 0.97 cm increase in waist circumference (95% CI: 0.21-0.65; P = 0.0002). Similar results were observed for rs8050136. may confer a modest susceptibility to obesity in an ethnicity-specific manner, but may be unlikely to contribute to a clinically significant diabetes risk.	[PMID 28381478] A small study (less than 700 women, divided into 4+ groups) concluded that over 3 & 6 months women in a weight-loss program who were informed they carried at least one rs9939609 risk allele lost slightly more weight than non-carriers.

rs762551	(A;A)	1.5	Faster caffeine metabolism in smokers and heavy coffee consumers	The baseline activity of the enzyme is similar in CYP1A2*1F allele carriers and non-carriers. However, rs762551(A) codes for the "high inducibility" form of the enzyme, characterized by higher enzyme activity in the presence of an inducer such as smoking or heavy coffee consumption [PMID 23167834]. In non-smokers, there was no significant difference in CYP1A2 activity between the genotypes. In smokers, however, the A/A homozygotes had 1.6x higher CYP1A2 activity than A/C and C/C genotypes [PMID 10233211]. Similarly, among non-smokers, only in heavy coffee consumers (more than 3 cups daily) the A/A homozygotes had about 1.4x higher CYP1A2 activity. There was no differences in CYP1A2 activity by genotype in non-heavy coffee consumers. [PMID 20390257]	A study of healthy premenopausal non-hormone using women concluded that drinkers of 3 or more cups of coffee per day tended to have lower breast volume (smaller breasts), but only if they had at least one rs762551(C) allele (p(interaction)=0.02), which was said to be consistent with reports that coffee protects only C-allele carriers against breast cancer.[PMID 18813311]	Another study by this same group looked at coffee consumption as related to breast cancer. Among 458 such patients (age 25-99 years), rs762551(A;A) women (about 1/2 of the total study) who drank 2 or more cups of coffee per day tended to have a later age at diagnosis compared with low coffee consumption (59.8 versus 52.6 years, p = 0.0004). These patients were also more likely to have ER- tumors than patients with low consumption (14.7% versus 0%, p = 0.018). Coffee consumption had no associations in carriers of a rs762551(C) allele.[PMID 18398030]	An independent study of 411 BRCA1 mutation carriers (170 cases and 241 controls) looked at the association between breast cancer, coffee consumption before age 35, and CYP1A2 genotype. While CYP1A2 genotype did not affect breast cancer risk, women with at least one rs762551(C) allele who consumed coffee had a 64% reduction in breast cancer risk, compared with women who never consumed coffee (odds ratio 0.36, CI: 0.18-0.73). No such protective effect was seen in rs762551(A;A) women.[PMID 17507615]	A study of 2,000 Costa Ricans who survived a first heart attack observed a general trend between coffee consumption and increased risk among carriers of rs762551(C) alleles, i.e. more coffee led to increased nonfatal heart attack risk.

In smokers, however, the A/A homozygotes had 1.6x higher CYP1A2 activity than A/C and C/C genotypes [PMID 10233211]. Similarly, among non-smokers, only in heavy coffee consumers (more than 3 cups daily) the A/A homozygotes had about 1.4x higher CYP1A2 activity. There was no differences in CYP1A2 activity by genotype in non-heavy coffee consumers. [PMID 20390257]	A study of healthy premenopausal non-hormone using women concluded that drinkers of 3 or more cups of coffee per day tended to have lower breast volume (smaller breasts), but only if they had at least one rs762551(C) allele (p(interaction)=0.02), which was said to be consistent with reports that coffee protects only C-allele carriers against breast cancer.[PMID 18813311]	Another study by this same group looked at coffee consumption as related to breast cancer. Among 458 such patients (age 25-99 years), rs762551(A;A) women (about 1/2 of the total study) who drank 2 or more cups of coffee per day tended to have a later age at diagnosis compared with low coffee consumption (59.8 versus 52.6 years, p = 0.0004). These patients were also more likely to have ER- tumors than patients with low consumption (14.7% versus 0%, p = 0.018). Coffee consumption had no associations in carriers of a rs762551(C) allele.[PMID 18398030]	An independent study of 411 BRCA1 mutation carriers (170 cases and 241 controls) looked at the association between breast cancer, coffee consumption before age 35, and CYP1A2 genotype. While CYP1A2 genotype did not affect breast cancer risk, women with at least one rs762551(C) allele who consumed coffee had a 64% reduction in breast cancer risk, compared with women who never consumed coffee (odds ratio 0.36, CI: 0.18-0.73). No such protective effect was seen in rs762551(A;A) women.[PMID 17507615]	A study of 2,000 Costa Ricans who survived a first heart attack observed a general trend between coffee consumption and increased risk among carriers of rs762551(C) alleles, i.e. more coffee led to increased nonfatal heart attack risk.

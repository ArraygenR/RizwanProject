rs2476601	(A;G)	2	Increased Risk of Multiple Autoimmune Disorders	[PMID 25003765] PTPN22: the archetypal non-HLA autoimmunity gene. A 2014 article explained that "PTPN22 exemplifies a shared autoimmunity gene, affecting the pathogenesis of systemic lupus erythematosus, vasculitis and other autoimmune diseases." They explored "the role of PTPN22 in autoimmune connective tissue disease" and theorized "a number of PTPN22-dependent functional models of the pathogenesis of autoimmune diseases." (Abstract). They explained that "the PTPN22 gene is a major risk factor for autoimmunity." As well, "In addition to autoimmune diseases, PTPN22 1858C>T also affects susceptibility to infectious diseases."	[PMID 15719322] A 2005 study titled "Analysis of families in the multiple autoimmune disease genetics consortium (MADGC) collection: the PTPN22 620W allele associates with multiple autoimmune phenotypes" stated "We report that a recently described functional single-nucleotide polymorphism (rs2476601, encoding R620W) in the intracellular tyrosine phosphatase (PTPN22) confers risk of four separate autoimmune phenotypes in these families: T1D, RA, SLE, and Hashimoto's thyroiditis. MS did not show association with the PTPN22 risk allele. These findings suggest a common underlying etiologic pathway for some, but not all, autoimmune disorders, and they suggest that MS may have a pathogenesis that is distinct from RA, SLE, and T1D."

They found that in the case of rs2476601, the risk was consistent with previous estimates for RA, approximately OD 1.8, and that "known associations with HLA-DRB1 and PTPN22 explain around 50% of the familial aggregation of RA." They found a correlated marker for RA, rs6679677. In addition, SNP rs11761231 had no effect on risk in males, but in females had an "additive OR for females 1.32"	[PMID 16175503] A 2005 study titled "PTPN22 genetic variation: evidence for multiple variants associated with rheumatoid arthritis" found that R620W rs2476601 polymorphism was the most significant SNP in sample set of 37 SNPs.

They explored "the role of PTPN22 in autoimmune connective tissue disease" and theorized "a number of PTPN22-dependent functional models of the pathogenesis of autoimmune diseases." (Abstract).

[PMID 15719322] A 2005 study titled "Analysis of families in the multiple autoimmune disease genetics consortium (MADGC) collection: the PTPN22 620W allele associates with multiple autoimmune phenotypes" stated "We report that a recently described functional single-nucleotide polymorphism (rs2476601, encoding R620W) in the intracellular tyrosine phosphatase (PTPN22) confers risk of four separate autoimmune phenotypes in these families: T1D, RA, SLE, and Hashimoto's thyroiditis. MS did not show association with the PTPN22 risk allele.

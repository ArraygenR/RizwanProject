Reduction of GDF5 in human cartilage of patients with OA by up to 27% has been observed [1]. This effect is influenced by a second SNP ( rs143384 , C/T ) in the same area. The C alleles of both SNPs form CpG dinucleotides. Demethylation of both SNP's increases GDF5 expression.[2] [PMID 21642387] "Expression of the osteoarthritis-associated gene GDF5 is modulated epigenetically by DNA methylation."

The original paper describing it is here [PMID 17434869].	rs9939609 has also been reported in a large study to be associated with type-2 diabetes.The risk allele (oriented to the dbSNP entry) is (A); the odds ratio associated with heterozygotes is 1.34 (CI 1.17-1.52), and for homozygotes, 1.55 (CI 1.3-1.84). [PMID 17554300]	In a different study, this SNP was found in a linkage block in the FTO gene with rs1121980; see rs1121980 for the association of this block with early onset obesity since it showed the strongest association.[PMID 18159244]	The increases in body mass index associated with rs9939609(A) carriers appears to begin at a young age and are maintained throughout adulthood, according to a study of 5,600+ Utah families.[PMID 18239580]	This SNP did not show any association with obesity, type-2 diabetes or any other related traits in a study of 3,210 Chinese subjects.

rs9939609	(A;T)	2.4	1.3x risk for T2D; obesity risk	rs9939609 is a SNP in the fat mass and obesity associated FTO gene, aka the "Fat Gene" [1]. The original paper describing it is here [PMID 17434869].	rs9939609 has also been reported in a large study to be associated with type-2 diabetes.The risk allele (oriented to the dbSNP entry) is (A); the odds ratio associated with heterozygotes is 1.34 (CI 1.17-1.52), and for homozygotes, 1.55 (CI 1.3-1.84). [PMID 17554300]	In a different study, this SNP was found in a linkage block in the FTO gene with rs1121980; see rs1121980 for the association of this block with early onset obesity since it showed the strongest association.[PMID 18159244]	The increases in body mass index associated with rs9939609(A) carriers appears to begin at a young age and are maintained throughout adulthood, according to a study of 5,600+ Utah families.[PMID 18239580]	This SNP did not show any association with obesity, type-2 diabetes or any other related traits in a study of 3,210 Chinese subjects. Furthermore, the minor allele frequency was much lower in Chinese populations compared to populations of European descent.[PMID 17959933]	[PMID 18437351] 1,638 type 2 diabetes patients and 1,858 controls	[PMID 18583465] A study of 3,000+ UK children indicated that (A;A) genotypes were less satieted (i.e. had greater appetite) than other genotypes, indicating this risk allele for obesity is likely to influence appetite.	[PMID 18379722] This SNP is also associated with (severe) obesity in a study of 927 Japanese patients.	[PMID 18948966] This SNP may contribute to variation in plasma C-reactive protein (CRP) levels independently of obesity; average CRP levels may be 12-14% higher per rs9939609(A) allele.	[PMID 18719664] This SNP is also associated with adult obesity in Mexicans.	[PMID 19158205] A longitudinal study of Finnish children concluded that the effect of rs9939609 on BMI only becomes evident after age 7, and that the FTO gene is not directly associated with energy intake or physical activity.	[PMID 19214238] Independent of fatness, the A-allele of the FTO SNP appears to increase mortality of a magnitude similar to smoking, but without a particular underlying disease pattern barring an increase in the risk of diseases of the nervous system.	[PMID 18787525] Each copy of the risk-allele A at rs9939609 was significantly associated with 0.45 kg/m(2) increase in BMI (95% confidence interval (CI): 0.16-0.74; P = 0.004) and 0.97 cm increase in waist circumference (95% CI: 0.21-0.65; P = 0.0002). Similar results were observed for rs8050136. may confer a modest susceptibility to obesity in an ethnicity-specific manner, but may be unlikely to contribute to a clinically significant diabetes risk.	[PMID 28381478] A small study (less than 700 women, divided into 4+ groups) concluded that over 3 & 6 months women in a weight-loss program who were informed they carried at least one rs9939609 risk allele lost slightly more weight than non-carriers.

rs9939609	(T;T)	1.5	lower risk of obesity and Type-2 diabetes	rs9939609 is a SNP in the fat mass and obesity associated FTO gene, aka the "Fat Gene" [1]. The original paper describing it is here [PMID 17434869].	rs9939609 has also been reported in a large study to be associated with type-2 diabetes.The risk allele (oriented to the dbSNP entry) is (A); the odds ratio associated with heterozygotes is 1.34 (CI 1.17-1.52), and for homozygotes, 1.55 (CI 1.3-1.84). [PMID 17554300]	In a different study, this SNP was found in a linkage block in the FTO gene with rs1121980; see rs1121980 for the association of this block with early onset obesity since it showed the strongest association.[PMID 18159244]	The increases in body mass index associated with rs9939609(A) carriers appears to begin at a young age and are maintained throughout adulthood, according to a study of 5,600+ Utah families.[PMID 18239580]	This SNP did not show any association with obesity, type-2 diabetes or any other related traits in a study of 3,210 Chinese subjects. Furthermore, the minor allele frequency was much lower in Chinese populations compared to populations of European descent.[PMID 17959933]	[PMID 18437351] 1,638 type 2 diabetes patients and 1,858 controls	[PMID 18583465] A study of 3,000+ UK children indicated that (A;A) genotypes were less satieted (i.e. had greater appetite) than other genotypes, indicating this risk allele for obesity is likely to influence appetite.	[PMID 18379722] This SNP is also associated with (severe) obesity in a study of 927 Japanese patients.	[PMID 18948966] This SNP may contribute to variation in plasma C-reactive protein (CRP) levels independently of obesity; average CRP levels may be 12-14% higher per rs9939609(A) allele.	[PMID 18719664] This SNP is also associated with adult obesity in Mexicans.	[PMID 19158205] A longitudinal study of Finnish children concluded that the effect of rs9939609 on BMI only becomes evident after age 7, and that the FTO gene is not directly associated with energy intake or physical activity.	[PMID 19214238] Independent of fatness, the A-allele of the FTO SNP appears to increase mortality of a magnitude similar to smoking, but without a particular underlying disease pattern barring an increase in the risk of diseases of the nervous system.	[PMID 18787525] Each copy of the risk-allele A at rs9939609 was significantly associated with 0.45 kg/m(2) increase in BMI (95% confidence interval (CI): 0.16-0.74; P = 0.004) and 0.97 cm increase in waist circumference (95% CI: 0.21-0.65; P = 0.0002). Similar results were observed for rs8050136. may confer a modest susceptibility to obesity in an ethnicity-specific manner, but may be unlikely to contribute to a clinically significant diabetes risk.	[PMID 28381478] A small study (less than 700 women, divided into 4+ groups) concluded that over 3 & 6 months women in a weight-loss program who were informed they carried at least one rs9939609 risk allele lost slightly more weight than non-carriers.

rs1799945	(C;C)	0	Not a H63D hemochromatosis carrier.	rs1799945, also known as H63D or His63Asp, represents a SNP that accounts for a mild form of hereditary hemochromatosis (HH), an iron overload condition in which mutations of certain genes involved in iron metabolism disrupt the body’s ability to regulate uptake of iron, causing increased intestinal iron absorption. The most common form is caused by mutations in the HFE gene, which are inherited recessively. The gene for HH is closely linked to the HLA-A3 locus on the short arm of chromosome 6 [PMID 1278715]. In 1996, HFE, a gene for HH, was found to have two missense mutations [PMID 8696333]. A mutation at amino acid 282 (C282Y) was found to be homozygous in 83 percent of patients with HH. This is a point mutation from guanine to adenine, resulting in a missense mutation from cysteine to tyrosine. Such mutations are commonly found in people with European ancestry, and is more rare in Asian and African populations. Among individuals of northern European descent, hereditary hemochromatosis is the most common inherited identified genetic disorder. However, penetrance differs between different populations.	HH has four main pathophysiological mechanisms [PMID 21452290]: the increased absorption of dietary iron in the upper intestine, 2) decreased expression of hepcidin, 3) altered function of the HFE protein, and 4) tissue injury and fibrogenesis induced by iron. Since the HFE gene encodes for proteins that affect pathways centered around liver hepcidin synthesis, this mechanism will be further explained in more detail. The HFE gene regulates the liver protein hepcidin, which is considered to be the principal iron-regulatory hormone. Levels of hepcidin increase when iron levels increase in the blood, preventing intestinal cells and macrophages from releasing iron into the bloodstream. When iron builds up in the cells, signals are produced to reduce the iron absorption from food. Hepcidin levels decrease when the body needs more iron. Mutations in the HFE gene such as C282Y and H63D decrease hepcidin levels, causing intestinal cells to think more iron is needed. Thus, more iron is absorbed. Concentrations of hepcidin in the urine negatively correlate with the severity of HH.

rs1799945	(G;G)	4	Two copies of H63D, likely affected by mild form of hemochromatosis	rs1799945, also known as H63D or His63Asp, represents a SNP that accounts for a mild form of hereditary hemochromatosis (HH), an iron overload condition in which mutations of certain genes involved in iron metabolism disrupt the body’s ability to regulate uptake of iron, causing increased intestinal iron absorption. The most common form is caused by mutations in the HFE gene, which are inherited recessively. The gene for HH is closely linked to the HLA-A3 locus on the short arm of chromosome 6 [PMID 1278715]. In 1996, HFE, a gene for HH, was found to have two missense mutations [PMID 8696333]. A mutation at amino acid 282 (C282Y) was found to be homozygous in 83 percent of patients with HH. This is a point mutation from guanine to adenine, resulting in a missense mutation from cysteine to tyrosine. Such mutations are commonly found in people with European ancestry, and is more rare in Asian and African populations. Among individuals of northern European descent, hereditary hemochromatosis is the most common inherited identified genetic disorder. However, penetrance differs between different populations.	HH has four main pathophysiological mechanisms [PMID 21452290]: the increased absorption of dietary iron in the upper intestine, 2) decreased expression of hepcidin, 3) altered function of the HFE protein, and 4) tissue injury and fibrogenesis induced by iron. Since the HFE gene encodes for proteins that affect pathways centered around liver hepcidin synthesis, this mechanism will be further explained in more detail. The HFE gene regulates the liver protein hepcidin, which is considered to be the principal iron-regulatory hormone. Levels of hepcidin increase when iron levels increase in the blood, preventing intestinal cells and macrophages from releasing iron into the bloodstream. When iron builds up in the cells, signals are produced to reduce the iron absorption from food. Hepcidin levels decrease when the body needs more iron. Mutations in the HFE gene such as C282Y and H63D decrease hepcidin levels, causing intestinal cells to think more iron is needed. Thus, more iron is absorbed. Concentrations of hepcidin in the urine negatively correlate with the severity of HH.

A 2014 article explained that "PTPN22 exemplifies a shared autoimmunity gene, affecting the pathogenesis of systemic lupus erythematosus, vasculitis and other autoimmune diseases." They explored "the role of PTPN22 in autoimmune connective tissue disease" and theorized "a number of PTPN22-dependent functional models of the pathogenesis of autoimmune diseases." (Abstract). They explained that "the PTPN22 gene is a major risk factor for autoimmunity." As well, "In addition to autoimmune diseases, PTPN22 1858C>T also affects susceptibility to infectious diseases."	[PMID 15719322] A 2005 study titled "Analysis of families in the multiple autoimmune disease genetics consortium (MADGC) collection: the PTPN22 620W allele associates with multiple autoimmune phenotypes" stated "We report that a recently described functional single-nucleotide polymorphism (rs2476601, encoding R620W) in the intracellular tyrosine phosphatase (PTPN22) confers risk of four separate autoimmune phenotypes in these families: T1D, RA, SLE, and Hashimoto's thyroiditis. MS did not show association with the PTPN22 risk allele. These findings suggest a common underlying etiologic pathway for some, but not all, autoimmune disorders, and they suggest that MS may have a pathogenesis that is distinct from RA, SLE, and T1D."

A 2014 article explained that "PTPN22 exemplifies a shared autoimmunity gene, affecting the pathogenesis of systemic lupus erythematosus, vasculitis and other autoimmune diseases." They explored "the role of PTPN22 in autoimmune connective tissue disease" and theorized "a number of PTPN22-dependent functional models of the pathogenesis of autoimmune diseases." (Abstract). They explained that "the PTPN22 gene is a major risk factor for autoimmunity." As well, "In addition to autoimmune diseases, PTPN22 1858C>T also affects susceptibility to infectious diseases."	[PMID 15719322] A 2005 study titled "Analysis of families in the multiple autoimmune disease genetics consortium (MADGC) collection: the PTPN22 620W allele associates with multiple autoimmune phenotypes" stated "We report that a recently described functional single-nucleotide polymorphism (rs2476601, encoding R620W) in the intracellular tyrosine phosphatase (PTPN22) confers risk of four separate autoimmune phenotypes in these families: T1D, RA, SLE, and Hashimoto's thyroiditis. MS did not show association with the PTPN22 risk allele.

rs2476601	(G;G)	0	Normal risk for autoimmune disorders	[PMID 25003765] PTPN22: the archetypal non-HLA autoimmunity gene. A 2014 article explained that "PTPN22 exemplifies a shared autoimmunity gene, affecting the pathogenesis of systemic lupus erythematosus, vasculitis and other autoimmune diseases." They explored "the role of PTPN22 in autoimmune connective tissue disease" and theorized "a number of PTPN22-dependent functional models of the pathogenesis of autoimmune diseases." (Abstract). They explained that "the PTPN22 gene is a major risk factor for autoimmunity." As well, "In addition to autoimmune diseases, PTPN22 1858C>T also affects susceptibility to infectious diseases."	[PMID 15719322] A 2005 study titled "Analysis of families in the multiple autoimmune disease genetics consortium (MADGC) collection: the PTPN22 620W allele associates with multiple autoimmune phenotypes" stated "We report that a recently described functional single-nucleotide polymorphism (rs2476601, encoding R620W) in the intracellular tyrosine phosphatase (PTPN22) confers risk of four separate autoimmune phenotypes in these families: T1D, RA, SLE, and Hashimoto's thyroiditis. MS did not show association with the PTPN22 risk allele. These findings suggest a common underlying etiologic pathway for some, but not all, autoimmune disorders, and they suggest that MS may have a pathogenesis that is distinct from RA, SLE, and T1D."

They found that in the case of rs2476601, the risk was consistent with previous estimates for RA, approximately OD 1.8, and that "known associations with HLA-DRB1 and PTPN22 explain around 50% of the familial aggregation of RA." They found a correlated marker for RA, rs6679677. In addition, SNP rs11761231 had no effect on risk in males, but in females had an "additive OR for females 1.32"	[PMID 16175503] A 2005 study titled "PTPN22 genetic variation: evidence for multiple variants associated with rheumatoid arthritis" found that R620W rs2476601 polymorphism was the most significant SNP in sample set of 37 SNPs.

The odds ratio for the (common) risk allele, rs599839(A), is 1.29 (CI: 1.18-1.40, adjusted p=0.0006).[PMID 17634449]	[PMID 18262040] rs599839 and rs4970834 explain about 1% of the variation in circulating LDL-cholesterol levels. "When we look at this particular genetic variance, of all the cholesterol variation among the population, 1% of it can be attributed to this particular locus," said Sandhu. "This is equivalent to more established genes for LDL regulation, particularly APOE."	Another study also reports an association between rs599839(A) and higher LDL levels, in over 4,000 Caucasian Europeans. In one study, the (A) allele is associated with a 6% increase in nonfasting serum LDL, and in another, with a 25% increase in fasting serum LDL.[PMID 18179892]	rs599839 is also considered one of the statistically stronger associations with abdominal aortic aneurysm; each (G) allele is reported as having an odds ratio of 0.8. This appears to correlate with lower LDL and higher HDL and the lower risk for coronary artery disease compared to (A;A) individuals.[PMID 23535823],[PMID 26460285]	rs646776 is a surrogate for rs599839, with linkage r2=0.88.[PMID 18979498] rs599839, rs4970834 and rs17228212 associated with non-HDL	[PMID 19380133] Significant impact of chromosomal locus 1p13.3 on serum LDL cholesterol and on angiographically characterized coronary atherosclerosis	[PMID 19164808] Large scale association analysis of novel genetic loci for coronary artery disease	[PMID 19487539] Large scale replication analysis of loci associated with lipid concentrations in a Japanese population	[PMID 19837406] Association of the single nucleotide polymorphism rs599839 in the vicinity of the sortilin 1 gene with LDL and triglyceride metabolism, coronary heart disease and myocardial infarction The Ludwigshafen Risk and Cardiovascular Health Study	[PMID 19955471] Genetic Variants Identified in a European Genome-Wide Association Study That Were Found to Predict Incident Coronary Heart Disease in the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities Study	[PMID 20370913] Genome-wide association analysis of total cholesterol and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels using the Framingham heart study data	[PMID 20694560] Common genetic polymorphisms in Moyamoya and atherosclerotic disease in Europeans	[PMID 21463265] Association of SNP rs17465637 on Chromosome 1q41 and rs599839 on 1p13.3 with Myocardial Infarction in an American Caucasian Population	[PMID 22537824] Smoking interacts with HLA-DRB1 shared epitope in the development of ACPA-positive rheumatoid arthritis: results from the Malaysian Epidemiological Investigation of Rheumatoid Arthritis (MyEIRA).

rs7566605	(C;C)	0.2	mixed evidence of increased obesity risk, may suppress excercise effects in men	rs7566605 was initially reported as being associated in at least 4 independent populations as being associated with obesity however replications are inconsistent, and a recent (2009) large meta-analysis comprising 34 studies (and over 70,000 subjects) has concluded that there is no evidence for overall association of the rs7566605 polymorphism with obesity.[PMID 19851442] See also: [PMID 16614226] Poster	At least one population has since been reported in which this association was not seen. [PMID 17218508] Furthermore, a study of 18,000 Danish subjects also failed to find any direct role for this SNP in the development of obesity, except that among physically inactive subjects, (C)-allele carriers tended to have a higher body mass index (by O.5 kg/m2) than (G)-allele carriers.[PMID 18682847]	On the other hand, a report has also been published indicating that obese children who are rs7566605(C;C) homozygotes find it harder to lose weight in clinical intervention programs than (C;G) heterozygotes or (G;G) homozygotes, which supports the association of SNP rs7566605 with obesity. [PMID 18003761]	[PMID 18570692] associated with the prevalence of hypercholesterolemia, but not with obesity, in Japanese American women. In Japanese American women, rs7566605(C;C) individuals had a 0.43-fold decreased risk (CI: 0.24 - 0.80) for hypercholesterolemia compared with the (G;G) homozygotes after adjustment for age and other factors. No significant differences in BMI, waist girth and percentage body fat according to the genotype in each of the four groups, which was divided by population and sex. The rs7566605(C;C) genotype is suggested to be a protective genetic factor against the progression of hypercholesterolemia on a high-fat diet, especially in Japanese female subjects.

rs7566605	(C;G)		?	rs7566605 was initially reported as being associated in at least 4 independent populations as being associated with obesity however replications are inconsistent, and a recent (2009) large meta-analysis comprising 34 studies (and over 70,000 subjects) has concluded that there is no evidence for overall association of the rs7566605 polymorphism with obesity.[PMID 19851442] See also: [PMID 16614226] Poster	At least one population has since been reported in which this association was not seen. [PMID 17218508] Furthermore, a study of 18,000 Danish subjects also failed to find any direct role for this SNP in the development of obesity, except that among physically inactive subjects, (C)-allele carriers tended to have a higher body mass index (by O.5 kg/m2) than (G)-allele carriers.[PMID 18682847]	On the other hand, a report has also been published indicating that obese children who are rs7566605(C;C) homozygotes find it harder to lose weight in clinical intervention programs than (C;G) heterozygotes or (G;G) homozygotes, which supports the association of SNP rs7566605 with obesity.

No significant differences in BMI, waist girth and percentage body fat according to the genotype in each of the four groups, which was divided by population and sex.

Genes in the GATA family are involved in several types of cancers including breast cancer, prostate cancer, and of particular interest to this entry, colorectal cancer [PMID 19798694] [PMID 23428429] [PMID 23348900] [PMID 21779441]. According to dbSNP, rs4143094 has two alleles, G (major allele) and T (minor allele). The minor allele has a frequency of 0.2337 across all populations.	A recent genome-wide association study (GWAS), using data from Colon Cancer Family Registry (CCFR) and the Genetics and Epidemiology of Colorectal Cancer Consortium (GECCO), discovered a strong correlation between rs4143094 and risk of colorectal cancer when ingesting red and processed meat [PMID 24743840]. In the study, approximately 2.7M SNPs were tested across 9,287 case and 9,117 control subjects, all with European ancestry.	The result shows that rs4143094 is associated with risk of colorectal cancer (P = 8.73e-9), with T being the risk allele. Specifically, individuals with TG and TT genotypes are increased for occurrence of colorectal cancer with odds ratio (OR) of 1.2 and 1.39, respectively. rs4143094 resides in a 9.5 kb linkage-disequilibrium (LD) block (r2 > 0.8) containing 19 highly correlated SNPs. The third most significant among these SNPs, rs1269486, is located 1420 bases upstream of GATA3 and is in a region of open chromatin (DNA hypersensitivity). Experimental evidence suggests binding activity of Pol2 and transcription factors c-Fos, JunD, and c-Jun in this region [PMID 23193274]. Many other SNPs in the LD block reside in GATA3-antisense RNA1 (GATA3-AS1).  GATA3-AS1 may regulate GATA3 transcript activity, although further experimental evidence is required.

rs671	(A;A)	4	Asian Flusher; increased risk of esophageal cancer; East Asian ancestry; Disulfiram not effective for alcoholism.	rs671 is a classic SNP, well known in a sense through the phenomena known as the "alcohol flush", also known as the "Asian Flush" or "Asian blush", in which certain individuals, often of Asian descent, have their face, neck and sometimes shoulders turn red after drinking alcohol.[PMID 6582480]	The rs671(A) allele of the ALDH2 gene is the culprit, in that it encodes a form of the aldehyde dehydrogenase 2 protein that is defective at metabolizing alcohol. This allele is known as the ALDH*2 form, and individuals possessing either one or two copies of it show alcohol-related sensitivity responses including facial flushing, and severe hangovers (and hence they are usually not regular drinkers). Perhaps not surprisingly they appear to suffer less from alcoholism and alcohol-related liver disease.

rs671	(A;G)	3.5	Asian Flush; worse hangovers; increased risk of esophageal cancer; East Asian ancestry; Disulfiram probably not effective for alcoholism.	rs671 is a classic SNP, well known in a sense through the phenomena known as the "alcohol flush", also known as the "Asian Flush" or "Asian blush", in which certain individuals, often of Asian descent, have their face, neck and sometimes shoulders turn red after drinking alcohol.[PMID 6582480]	The rs671(A) allele of the ALDH2 gene is the culprit, in that it encodes a form of the aldehyde dehydrogenase 2 protein that is defective at metabolizing alcohol. This allele is known as the ALDH*2 form, and individuals possessing either one or two copies of it show alcohol-related sensitivity responses including facial flushing, and severe hangovers (and hence they are usually not regular drinkers). Perhaps not surprisingly they appear to suffer less from alcoholism and alcohol-related liver disease.

Furthermore, individuals with the 3-locus genotype pattern (T;T)-(T;T)-(T;T) for SNPs rs1045642, rs2032582 and rs1128503, respectively, had an approximately 5-fold chance of requiring the 'higher' methadone dose, while individuals heterozygous for these three SNPs have an approximately 3-fold chance of stabilizing at the 'lower' methadone dose (point-wise p-value = 0.026).[PMID 18424454]	[PMID 19437139] ABCB1 single nucleotide polymorphisms in the Brazilian population	[PMID 20664232] Antidepressants and ABCB1 Gene C3435T Functional Polymorphism: A Naturalistic Study	[PMID 20944127] Two multidrug-resistance (ABCB1) gene polymorphisms as prognostic parameters in women with ovarian cancer	[PMID 21247447] CYP2C19 and ABCB1 gene polymorphisms are differently distributed according to ethnicity in the Brazilian general population	[PMID 21902503] ABCB1 polymorphisms and neuropsychiatric adverse events in oseltamivir-treated children during influenza H1N1/09 pandemia	[PMID 22015057] Single nucleotide polymorphism associations with response and toxic effects in patients with advanced renal-cell carcinoma treated with first-line sunitinib: a multicentre, observational, prospective study	[PMID 22110582] Association of MDR1 Gene SNPs and Haplotypes with the Tacrolimus Dose Requirements in Han Chinese Liver Transplant Recipients	[PMID 22120734] Identification of pharmacogenetic predictors of lipid-lowering response to atorvastatin in Chilean subjects with hypercholesterolemia	[PMID 21705081] Multidrug resistance gene expression and ABCB1 SNPs in plasma cell myeloma	[PMID 22176633] ABCB1/MDR1 polymorphism and colorectal cancer risk: a meta-analysis of case-control studies	[PMID 21806386] Pharmacogenetics of calcineurin inhibitors in Brazilian renal transplant patients	[PMID 22416375] [Genetic performance criteria valproate in patients with epilepsy]	[PMID 22630058] ABCC2 Polymorphisms and Haplotype are Associated with Drug Resistance in Chinese Epileptic Patients	[PMID 15197162] Identifying candidate causal variants responsible for altered activity of the ABCB1 multidrug resistance gene.

rs1421085	(C;C)	3.1	~1.7x increased obesity risk	rs1421085 is a SNP located in the first intron of the FTO (fat mass and obesity associated) gene on chromosome 16. This SNP showed the most association with obesity in the original work by Dina et al [PMID 17496892].	[PMID 26287746] The rs1421085 T-to- C single-nucleotide alteration underlies the association between FTO and obesity by disrupting ARID5B-mediated repression of IRX3 and IRX5. This disruption leads to a developmental shift from browning to whitening programs and loss of mitochondrial thermogenesis	Within the FTO gene, many SNPs appear to be co-inherited. The SNP showing the strongest association with body weight (i.e. body mass index, BMI) is not rs1421085, although this SNP is one of co-inherited SNPs in the FTO gene region. For more information, refer to the FTO gene or the most studied of FTO SNPs, rs9930506. [PMID 17658951]	However, in one study of 583 extremely obese women with several FTO SNPs, the strongest association was indeed with rs1421085 (p=3.04x10-10, OR = 1.75, CI: 1.47-2.08).[PMID 18218107]	[PMID 18719664] This SNP is also associated with adult obesity in Mexicans.

rs1421085	(C;T)	2.5	~1.3x increased obesity risk	rs1421085 is a SNP located in the first intron of the FTO (fat mass and obesity associated) gene on chromosome 16. This SNP showed the most association with obesity in the original work by Dina et al [PMID 17496892].	[PMID 26287746] The rs1421085 T-to- C single-nucleotide alteration underlies the association between FTO and obesity by disrupting ARID5B-mediated repression of IRX3 and IRX5. This disruption leads to a developmental shift from browning to whitening programs and loss of mitochondrial thermogenesis	Within the FTO gene, many SNPs appear to be co-inherited. The SNP showing the strongest association with body weight (i.e. body mass index, BMI) is not rs1421085, although this SNP is one of co-inherited SNPs in the FTO gene region. For more information, refer to the FTO gene or the most studied of FTO SNPs, rs9930506. [PMID 17658951]	However, in one study of 583 extremely obese women with several FTO SNPs, the strongest association was indeed with rs1421085 (p=3.04x10-10, OR = 1.75, CI: 1.47-2.08).[PMID 18218107]	[PMID 18719664] This SNP is also associated with adult obesity in Mexicans.

rs1800469	(C;C)	1	lower TGF-β1 levels, higher risk for COPD?	rs1800469, also known as -509 C>T, C509T or −1347 C>T, is an SNP in the promoter region of the transforming growth factor beta1 TGFB1 gene. That means it doesn't change the nature of the TGF-β1 protein, but it does change the amount produced. The T version increases the amount of TGF-β1 produced, by preventing AP1 from binding to this region where in the C version it would normally downregulate production. That increased TGF-β1 production with the T version is probably what causes all the health effects of this SNP. [PMID 16896927] Whether increased TGF-β1 is good or bad probably depends on the disease you are interested in.	It has been associated with increased risk for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Although smoking is the main risk factor, smokers with a rs1800469(C) allele (or 2 other TGFB1 SNPs, rs1982073 and rs2241712) were more likely to develop COPD, based on a study of ~700 Caucasian subjects [PMID 15175276]	Although based on a relatively small number of patients, a 2018 study concluded that women with breast cancer receiving radiation who carry a rs1800469(T) allele are at ~4x higher risk of radiation-induced fibrosis (scarring) and related poor cosmetic outcomes compared to women who are rs1800469(C;C).[PMID 30027292]	{{PMID Auto|PMID=19258388|Title=Genetic variation in the transforming growth factor-{beta}1 gene is associated with susceptibility to IgA nephropathy|OA=1}}	[PMID 19380441] Single Nucleotide Polymorphism at rs1982073:T869C of the TGF{beta}1 Gene Is Associated With the Risk of Radiation Pneumonitis in Patients With Non-Small-Cell Lung Cancer Treated With Definitive Radiotherapy	[PMID 19559392] A candidate gene association study of 77 polymorphisms in migraine	[PMID 22053598] Association of TGF-beta1, IL-4 and IL-13 gene polymerphisms with asthma in a Chinese population	[PMID 22282866] The Effects of Functional Polymorphisms in the TGF?1 Gene on Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma Susceptibility	[PMID 22513132] Interaction between smoking and functional polymorphism in the TGFB1 gene is associated with ischaemic heart disease and myocardial infarction in patients with rheumatoid arthritis: a cross-sectional study	[PMID 22558067] Genes in the ureteric budding pathway: association study on vesico-ureteral reflux patients.

rs1800469	(T;T)	1	higher TGF-β1 levels	rs1800469, also known as -509 C>T, C509T or −1347 C>T, is an SNP in the promoter region of the transforming growth factor beta1 TGFB1 gene. That means it doesn't change the nature of the TGF-β1 protein, but it does change the amount produced. The T version increases the amount of TGF-β1 produced, by preventing AP1 from binding to this region where in the C version it would normally downregulate production. That increased TGF-β1 production with the T version is probably what causes all the health effects of this SNP. [PMID 16896927] Whether increased TGF-β1 is good or bad probably depends on the disease you are interested in.	It has been associated with increased risk for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Although smoking is the main risk factor, smokers with a rs1800469(C) allele (or 2 other TGFB1 SNPs, rs1982073 and rs2241712) were more likely to develop COPD, based on a study of ~700 Caucasian subjects [PMID 15175276]	Although based on a relatively small number of patients, a 2018 study concluded that women with breast cancer receiving radiation who carry a rs1800469(T) allele are at ~4x higher risk of radiation-induced fibrosis (scarring) and related poor cosmetic outcomes compared to women who are rs1800469(C;C).[PMID 30027292]	{{PMID Auto|PMID=19258388|Title=Genetic variation in the transforming growth factor-{beta}1 gene is associated with susceptibility to IgA nephropathy|OA=1}}	[PMID 19380441] Single Nucleotide Polymorphism at rs1982073:T869C of the TGF{beta}1 Gene Is Associated With the Risk of Radiation Pneumonitis in Patients With Non-Small-Cell Lung Cancer Treated With Definitive Radiotherapy	[PMID 19559392] A candidate gene association study of 77 polymorphisms in migraine	[PMID 22053598] Association of TGF-beta1, IL-4 and IL-13 gene polymerphisms with asthma in a Chinese population	[PMID 22282866] The Effects of Functional Polymorphisms in the TGF?1 Gene on Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma Susceptibility	[PMID 22513132] Interaction between smoking and functional polymorphism in the TGFB1 gene is associated with ischaemic heart disease and myocardial infarction in patients with rheumatoid arthritis: a cross-sectional study	[PMID 22558067] Genes in the ureteric budding pathway: association study on vesico-ureteral reflux patients.

In non-smokers, there was no significant difference in CYP1A2 activity between the genotypes. In smokers, however, the A/A homozygotes had 1.6x higher CYP1A2 activity than A/C and C/C genotypes [PMID 10233211]. Similarly, among non-smokers, only in heavy coffee consumers (more than 3 cups daily) the A/A homozygotes had about 1.4x higher CYP1A2 activity. There was no differences in CYP1A2 activity by genotype in non-heavy coffee consumers. [PMID 20390257]	A study of healthy premenopausal non-hormone using women concluded that drinkers of 3 or more cups of coffee per day tended to have lower breast volume (smaller breasts), but only if they had at least one rs762551(C) allele (p(interaction)=0.02), which was said to be consistent with reports that coffee protects only C-allele carriers against breast cancer.[PMID 18813311]	Another study by this same group looked at coffee consumption as related to breast cancer.

rs4810485	(G;G)	1.4	Normal risk for rheumatoid arthritis	rs4810485 is a SNP associated with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), a chronic autoimmune disease characterized by joint inflammation. At this locus, the minor allele, T, protects against RA. The SNP is located on chromosome 20q13 in the second intron of the CD40 gene, which encodes a receptor that is expressed on the surface of multiple immune cells. CD40 binds the ligand CD154 which is expressed by activated T cells, and this interaction plays a critical role in T cell helper activity in the immune system. rs4810495 is closely linked with another SNP, rs1883832, that appears to lesson translation of the CD40 gene, affecting this critical signaling pathway that leads to B cell proliferation [PMID 17344890]. Mouse model knockouts of CD40 have been shown to alleviate arthritis [PMID 9379064].	The association between rs4810485 and RA was first identified through a genome-wide association study (GWAS) meta-analysis and two subsequent replication studies in patients with European ancestry [PMID 18794853]. This study looked at the major allele G versus the minor allele T in a meta-analysis of previous GWAS followed by two replication studies. In the GWAS meta-analysis, which had 3,393 cases and 12,460 controls, they found rs4810485 to be associated with RA with a p-value of 2.4x10-7 and an odds ratio of 0.83. Two replication studies looking at 31 loci in combined 3,929 cases and 5,807 controls found the position to be associated with the disease with a p-value of 0.0032 and an odds ratio of 0.91. Jointly, the meta-analysis and replication studies showed an association with a p-value of 8.2x10-9 surpassing a conservative level of significance for joint analysis and an odds ratio of 0.87, suggesting that the minor allele T gives a modest protective effect against RA.	The association with RA was confirmed in a targeted validation study in the United Kingdom with 3,962 cases and 3,531 control patients [PMID 19435719]. This study found rs4810485 to be associated with RA with a p-value of 2x10-4 and an odds ratio of 0.86. Since this was a targeted study looking at 4 specific loci, the p-value is significant. Again, the odds ratio suggests a modest protective affect for the minor allele T.	An additional study looked at this SNP and its association with RA in individuals of Korean ancestry [PMID 19180477]. This study found no association between rs4810485 and RA in patients with Korean ancestry. The targeted validation study looked at 5 SNPs associated with RA in Europeans in 1,113 Korean cases and 988 controls, and found a p-value of 0.39 and an odds ratio of 1.06, suggesting no association between the SNP and RA in Koreans. This case highlights the importance of accounting for ancestry when testing genome-wide associations.

rs4810485	(T;T)	1.8	0.87 reduced risk for rheumatoid athritis	rs4810485 is a SNP associated with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), a chronic autoimmune disease characterized by joint inflammation. At this locus, the minor allele, T, protects against RA. The SNP is located on chromosome 20q13 in the second intron of the CD40 gene, which encodes a receptor that is expressed on the surface of multiple immune cells. CD40 binds the ligand CD154 which is expressed by activated T cells, and this interaction plays a critical role in T cell helper activity in the immune system. rs4810495 is closely linked with another SNP, rs1883832, that appears to lesson translation of the CD40 gene, affecting this critical signaling pathway that leads to B cell proliferation [PMID 17344890]. Mouse model knockouts of CD40 have been shown to alleviate arthritis [PMID 9379064].	The association between rs4810485 and RA was first identified through a genome-wide association study (GWAS) meta-analysis and two subsequent replication studies in patients with European ancestry [PMID 18794853]. This study looked at the major allele G versus the minor allele T in a meta-analysis of previous GWAS followed by two replication studies. In the GWAS meta-analysis, which had 3,393 cases and 12,460 controls, they found rs4810485 to be associated with RA with a p-value of 2.4x10-7 and an odds ratio of 0.83. Two replication studies looking at 31 loci in combined 3,929 cases and 5,807 controls found the position to be associated with the disease with a p-value of 0.0032 and an odds ratio of 0.91. Jointly, the meta-analysis and replication studies showed an association with a p-value of 8.2x10-9 surpassing a conservative level of significance for joint analysis and an odds ratio of 0.87, suggesting that the minor allele T gives a modest protective effect against RA.	The association with RA was confirmed in a targeted validation study in the United Kingdom with 3,962 cases and 3,531 control patients [PMID 19435719]. This study found rs4810485 to be associated with RA with a p-value of 2x10-4 and an odds ratio of 0.86. Since this was a targeted study looking at 4 specific loci, the p-value is significant. Again, the odds ratio suggests a modest protective affect for the minor allele T.	An additional study looked at this SNP and its association with RA in individuals of Korean ancestry [PMID 19180477]. This study found no association between rs4810485 and RA in patients with Korean ancestry. The targeted validation study looked at 5 SNPs associated with RA in Europeans in 1,113 Korean cases and 988 controls, and found a p-value of 0.39 and an odds ratio of 1.06, suggesting no association between the SNP and RA in Koreans. This case highlights the importance of accounting for ancestry when testing genome-wide associations.

Also, the carriage of at least one G allele in these positions increased the risk of disease (p=0.006 and, p=0.008, respectively). Carrying a haplotype with the G allele in all three promoter SNPs increased the risk of symptomatic DIP OA more than four-fold (OR 4.45, p=0.001). Carriage of the G-G diplotype indicated an increased risk of both symmetrical DIP OA (OR 1.52 95% CI 1.01 to 2.28) and symptomatic DIP OA (OR 3.67 95% CI 1.50 to 9.00)	[PMID 18056967] Suggests that "healthy elderly individuals may have a proinflammatory profile playing as a downregulating factor for inducible Hsp70, particularly if -174 G/C-negative" and that therefore, a nutraceutical intervention (fermented papaya preparation 9 g/day) might be of benefit.

rs1800795	(C;G)		complex; see details	It was first described in 1998, when it was shown that the rs1800795(C) allele produces less IL6 than the (G) allele, which supported the hypothesis that a protective genotype against systemic onset juvenile rheumatoid arthritis would be rs1800795(C;C), and indeed, few juvenile RA patients had that genotype.[PMID 9769329]	[PMID 18257935] rs1800797, rs1800796 and rs1800795 have been shown to affect both the transcription and secretion of IL-6, to symptomatic distal interphalangeal osteoarthritis based on 535 women. the G alleles of two promoter single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) G-597A and G-174C were more common among the subjects with symptomatic DIP OA than among those with no disease (p-values corrected for multiple testing 0.020 and 0.024). Also, the carriage of at least one G allele in these positions increased the risk of disease (p=0.006 and, p=0.008, respectively). Carrying a haplotype with the G allele in all three promoter SNPs increased the risk of symptomatic DIP OA more than four-fold (OR 4.45, p=0.001). Carriage of the G-G diplotype indicated an increased risk of both symmetrical DIP OA (OR 1.52 95% CI 1.01 to 2.28) and symptomatic DIP OA (OR 3.67 95% CI 1.50 to 9.00)	[PMID 18056967] Suggests that "healthy elderly individuals may have a proinflammatory profile playing as a downregulating factor for inducible Hsp70, particularly if -174 G/C-negative" and that therefore, a nutraceutical intervention (fermented papaya preparation 9 g/day) might be of benefit.

Also, the carriage of at least one G allele in these positions increased the risk of disease (p=0.006 and, p=0.008, respectively). Carrying a haplotype with the G allele in all three promoter SNPs increased the risk of symptomatic DIP OA more than four-fold (OR 4.45, p=0.001).

Abstract stated "The specific variant of the DIO2 gene, namely the CC genotype of the Thr92Ala polymorphism, was more frequently found in healthy subjects than in patients with depression, what suggests that it could potentially serve as a marker of a lower risk for recurrent depressive disorder. The distribution of four haplotypes was also significantly different between the two study groups with the TC (Thr-Gly) haplotype more frequently detected in patients with depression."

Findings in abstract: "Both SNPs were significantly higher in the BPAD (Bipolar disorder) patients, with odds ratios of 1.489 ... and 1.616 ... respectively. Individuals with two copies of the variant 3Gly or 92Ala were at greater risk of BPAD....

rs4880	(C;T)	1.1	complex! see rs4880	There appears to be some conflict in the literature over the effect of this SNP. Having a valine at codon 16 is said to reduce enzyme activity [PMID 15864132], and thus lead to increased oxidative stress, yet in at least one study of the actual enzyme levels measured in people, SOD2 activity was 33% higher in (C;T) or (T;T) individuals compared to (C;C) individuals [PMID 16538174]. Regardless of how this resolves, several phenotypic associations have been reported for this SNP, including:	The C allele of rs4880 appears to be slightly associated with Alzheimer's disease.

rs1801131	(A;C)	2.1	Possibly impaired folate metabolism	A diplotype (according to the authors, but perhaps actually a genoset) of rs1801131 and rs1801133 has been linked to slightly increased risk for several types of brain cancer. The highest risk of meningioma was associated with heterozygosity for both MTHFR SNPs (odds ratio 2.11, CI: 1.42-3.12, p=0.002). The corresponding odds ratio for glioma was 1.23 (CI: 0.91-1.66, p=0.02.

rs1801131	(C;C)	2.5	Number of risks. Complex.	A diplotype (according to the authors, but perhaps actually a genoset) of rs1801131 and rs1801133 has been linked to slightly increased risk for several types of brain cancer. The highest risk of meningioma was associated with heterozygosity for both MTHFR SNPs (odds ratio 2.11, CI: 1.42-3.12, p=0.002). The corresponding odds ratio for glioma was 1.23 (CI: 0.91-1.66, p=0.02. In general, risks were increased with genotypes associated with reduced MTHFR activity.[PMID 18483342]	[PMID 19336565] Folate Intake, Methylenetetrahydrofolate Reductase Polymorphisms, and Breast Cancer Risk in Women from the Malmo Diet and Cancer Cohort.

rs1695	(A;A)	0	normal asthma risk in certain populations	Despite evidence of antioxidant effects of vitamin E in vitro and in animal studies, large, randomized clinical trials have not substantiated a benefit of vitamin E in reducing inflammation in humans. In healthy control subjects, the effect of α-tocopherol supplementation on the production of inflammatory cytokines appears to be dependent on an individual's genotype. These genotype-specific differences may help explain some of the discordant results in studies that used vitamin E. Persons having the alleles AA or AG had an increase in interleukin-6 (IL-6) upon supplementing alpha-tocopherol (the most common form of Vitamin E in a North American diet) while those with GG saw a decrease.

rs1695	(A;G)		?	Despite evidence of antioxidant effects of vitamin E in vitro and in animal studies, large, randomized clinical trials have not substantiated a benefit of vitamin E in reducing inflammation in humans. In healthy control subjects, the effect of α-tocopherol supplementation on the production of inflammatory cytokines appears to be dependent on an individual's genotype. These genotype-specific differences may help explain some of the discordant results in studies that used vitamin E. Persons having the alleles AA or AG had an increase in interleukin-6 (IL-6) upon supplementing alpha-tocopherol (the most common form of Vitamin E in a North American diet) while those with GG saw a decrease. [PMID 22572643]	Several papers published findings associating GSTP1 Ile105Val genotypes with bronchial, childhood, or atopic asthma. [PMID 15612961]	Note that some studies, however, have not observed any association between this SNP and asthma in certain populations [PMID 16176403], or even more paradoxically, have observed that rs1695(G;G) homozygotes appear to be somewhat protected (OR 0.29) from developing asthma compared to individuals with rs1695(A;G) or (A;A) genotypes. [PMID 14748821]	A cohort of 1,610 children in the US were studied to determine that the risk for new-onset asthma was highest in rs1695(A;A) homozygotes who participated in 3 or more sports in high-ozone communities. These children were at 6x higher risk (CI: 2.2-7.4). [PMID 18988661]	A study of 3,000 Chinese women with breast cancer concluded that rs1695(G;G) genotype was significantly associated with greater breast cancer risk, particularly in premenopausal women (odds ratio 1.69, CI: 1.17-2.43). The odds increased further if such women reported eating little cruciferous vegetables (then the odds ratio was 2.08, CI: 1.20-3.59).[PMID 18326615]	A relatively small study of 58 patients with different types of cancer receiving docetaxel concluded that rs1695(A;A) homozygotes (i.e. Ile105/Ile105 homozygotes) had a higher risk of developing docetaxel-induced peripheral neuropathy (DIPN), particularly grade 2 or higher.

rs1695	(G;G)	2.1	3.5x asthma risk in certain populations	Despite evidence of antioxidant effects of vitamin E in vitro and in animal studies, large, randomized clinical trials have not substantiated a benefit of vitamin E in reducing inflammation in humans. In healthy control subjects, the effect of α-tocopherol supplementation on the production of inflammatory cytokines appears to be dependent on an individual's genotype. These genotype-specific differences may help explain some of the discordant results in studies that used vitamin E. Persons having the alleles AA or AG had an increase in interleukin-6 (IL-6) upon supplementing alpha-tocopherol (the most common form of Vitamin E in a North American diet) while those with GG saw a decrease. [PMID 22572643]	Several papers published findings associating GSTP1 Ile105Val genotypes with bronchial, childhood, or atopic asthma. [PMID 15612961]	Note that some studies, however, have not observed any association between this SNP and asthma in certain populations [PMID 16176403], or even more paradoxically, have observed that rs1695(G;G) homozygotes appear to be somewhat protected (OR 0.29) from developing asthma compared to individuals with rs1695(A;G) or (A;A) genotypes. [PMID 14748821]	A cohort of 1,610 children in the US were studied to determine that the risk for new-onset asthma was highest in rs1695(A;A) homozygotes who participated in 3 or more sports in high-ozone communities. These children were at 6x higher risk (CI: 2.2-7.4). [PMID 18988661]	A study of 3,000 Chinese women with breast cancer concluded that rs1695(G;G) genotype was significantly associated with greater breast cancer risk, particularly in premenopausal women (odds ratio 1.69, CI: 1.17-2.43). The odds increased further if such women reported eating little cruciferous vegetables (then the odds ratio was 2.08, CI: 1.20-3.59).[PMID 18326615]	A relatively small study of 58 patients with different types of cancer receiving docetaxel concluded that rs1695(A;A) homozygotes (i.e. Ile105/Ile105 homozygotes) had a higher risk of developing docetaxel-induced peripheral neuropathy (DIPN), particularly grade 2 or higher.

rs4680	(A;A)	2.5	(worrier) advantage in memory and attention tasks	Roughly speaking, the predominant wisdom (known colloquially as the warrior/worrier hypothesis; summary at [PMID 17008817]) posits that people with Val alleles have increased COMT activity and lower prefrontal extracellular dopamine compared with those with the Met substitution. Val158 alleles may be associated with an advantage in the processing of aversive stimuli (warrior strategy), while Met158 alleles may be associated with an advantage in memory and attention tasks (worrier strategy). Under conditions of increased dopamine release (eg, stress), individuals with Val158 alleles may have improved dopaminergic transmission and better performance, while individuals with Met158 alleles may have less efficient neurotransmission and worse performance. Some evidence suggests that Val158 alleles are associated with schizophrenia, while Met158 alleles are associated with anxiety.	A study of 400 individuals reported that an increase in plasma total homocysteine (tHcy) of 10.4% (CI: 0.01-0.21, p=0.03) for associated with rs4680(A;A) homozygotes compared with rs4680(G;G) subjects. The (A;A) genotype was also more common, but statistically not that significantly, in venous thrombosis patients (OR 1.61, CI: 0.97-2.65], p=0.06) compared to control subjects.[PMID 18064318]	And from [PMID 15866551]:  "Adolescent cannabis use was associated with increased risk of schizophreniform disorder in adulthood among Val/Val (i.e. rs4680(G;G)) individuals (OR = 10.9, 95% CI: 2.2â€“54.1) and, to a lesser extent, among Met/Val individuals (rs4680(A;G)); OR = 2.5, 95% CI: .78 â€“ 8.2), but not among Met/Met (rs4680(A;A)) individuals (OR = 1.1, 95% CI: .21â€“5.4)."	In a study of 2 populations of breast cancer patients (2,000+ patients), increased risk was associated with rs4680(G;G) genotypes in both the Ontario [odds ratio 2.22, CI: 1.49-3.28] and Finland [OR 1.73, CI: 1.08-2.78] populations.[PMID 18194538]	[PMID 18704099] A study of 330 cocaine-dependent individuals, all of African descent, concluded that there was a slight (odds ratio 1.44, CI: 1.12-1.86, p = 0.014) association between the rs4680(A) allele, in other words the Met encoding allele, and cocaine dependence.

rs4680	(A;G)		Intermediate dopamine levels, other effects	Roughly speaking, the predominant wisdom (known colloquially as the warrior/worrier hypothesis; summary at [PMID 17008817]) posits that people with Val alleles have increased COMT activity and lower prefrontal extracellular dopamine compared with those with the Met substitution. Val158 alleles may be associated with an advantage in the processing of aversive stimuli (warrior strategy), while Met158 alleles may be associated with an advantage in memory and attention tasks (worrier strategy). Under conditions of increased dopamine release (eg, stress), individuals with Val158 alleles may have improved dopaminergic transmission and better performance, while individuals with Met158 alleles may have less efficient neurotransmission and worse performance. Some evidence suggests that Val158 alleles are associated with schizophrenia, while Met158 alleles are associated with anxiety.	A study of 400 individuals reported that an increase in plasma total homocysteine (tHcy) of 10.4% (CI: 0.01-0.21, p=0.03) for associated with rs4680(A;A) homozygotes compared with rs4680(G;G) subjects. The (A;A) genotype was also more common, but statistically not that significantly, in venous thrombosis patients (OR 1.61, CI: 0.97-2.65], p=0.06) compared to control subjects.[PMID 18064318]	And from [PMID 15866551]:  "Adolescent cannabis use was associated with increased risk of schizophreniform disorder in adulthood among Val/Val (i.e. rs4680(G;G)) individuals (OR = 10.9, 95% CI: 2.2â€“54.1) and, to a lesser extent, among Met/Val individuals (rs4680(A;G)); OR = 2.5, 95% CI: .78 â€“ 8.2), but not among Met/Met (rs4680(A;A)) individuals (OR = 1.1, 95% CI: .21â€“5.4)."	In a study of 2 populations of breast cancer patients (2,000+ patients), increased risk was associated with rs4680(G;G) genotypes in both the Ontario [odds ratio 2.22, CI: 1.49-3.28] and Finland [OR 1.73, CI: 1.08-2.78] populations.[PMID 18194538]	[PMID 18704099] A study of 330 cocaine-dependent individuals, all of African descent, concluded that there was a slight (odds ratio 1.44, CI: 1.12-1.86, p = 0.014) association between the rs4680(A) allele, in other words the Met encoding allele, and cocaine dependence.	[PMID 18989660] A study of the antidepressant paroxetine found better response in Met/Met homozygotes, worse effects in Val/Val homozygotes and intermediate effects in heterozygotes. The effect became significant at the third week of treatment. Paroxetine daily dose was proportional to baseline severity, but did not influence outcome.	A meta-analysis of neuroimaging studies found a significant association between the COMT genotype and prefrontal activation; strong and opposing effects were found for executive cognition paradigms (favoring Met allele carriers) and emotional paradigms (favoring Val).[PMID 19417742]	[PMID 19071221] gray matter volume and interacts with rs2097603 related to extracellular dopamine	[PMID 19207030] rs6275/DRD2 and rs4680/COMT useful in predicting disease risk among schizophrenia patients	[PMID 19037200] rs4680(G;G) carriers deprived of sleep respond quite well to 2x 100mg modafinil in terms of improved vigor and well-being, and maintained baseline performance with respect to executive functioning, whereas rs4680(A;A) individuals barely responded to the drug at all.	[PMID 16878403] Met158 allele carriers had "a more focused response...during a working memory task." "The met158 allele seems to be beneficial during the performance of working memory and attention-related tasks, whereas the val158 allele appears to be advantageous during the processing of aversive emotional stimuli."	[PMID 15673663] "Increased limbic and prefrontal activation elicited by unpleasant stimuli in subjects with more met158 alleles might contribute to the observed lower emotional resilience against negative mood states."	[PMID 12595695] In response to pain Met/Met allele carriers showed greater "sensory and affective ratings of pain and a more negative internal affective state. Opposite effects were observed in val158 homozygotes. The COMT val158met polymorphism thus influences the human experience of pain and may underlie interindividual differences in the adaptation and responses to pain and other stressful stimuli."

rs4680	(G;G)	2.5	(warrior) multiple associations, see details	Roughly speaking, the predominant wisdom (known colloquially as the warrior/worrier hypothesis; summary at [PMID 17008817]) posits that people with Val alleles have increased COMT activity and lower prefrontal extracellular dopamine compared with those with the Met substitution. Val158 alleles may be associated with an advantage in the processing of aversive stimuli (warrior strategy), while Met158 alleles may be associated with an advantage in memory and attention tasks (worrier strategy). Under conditions of increased dopamine release (eg, stress), individuals with Val158 alleles may have improved dopaminergic transmission and better performance, while individuals with Met158 alleles may have less efficient neurotransmission and worse performance. Some evidence suggests that Val158 alleles are associated with schizophrenia, while Met158 alleles are associated with anxiety.	A study of 400 individuals reported that an increase in plasma total homocysteine (tHcy) of 10.4% (CI: 0.01-0.21, p=0.03) for associated with rs4680(A;A) homozygotes compared with rs4680(G;G) subjects. The (A;A) genotype was also more common, but statistically not that significantly, in venous thrombosis patients (OR 1.61, CI: 0.97-2.65], p=0.06) compared to control subjects.[PMID 18064318]	And from [PMID 15866551]:  "Adolescent cannabis use was associated with increased risk of schizophreniform disorder in adulthood among Val/Val (i.e. rs4680(G;G)) individuals (OR = 10.9, 95% CI: 2.2â€“54.1) and, to a lesser extent, among Met/Val individuals (rs4680(A;G)); OR = 2.5, 95% CI: .78 â€“ 8.2), but not among Met/Met (rs4680(A;A)) individuals (OR = 1.1, 95% CI: .21â€“5.4)."	In a study of 2 populations of breast cancer patients (2,000+ patients), increased risk was associated with rs4680(G;G) genotypes in both the Ontario [odds ratio 2.22, CI: 1.49-3.28] and Finland [OR 1.73, CI: 1.08-2.78] populations.[PMID 18194538]	[PMID 18704099] A study of 330 cocaine-dependent individuals, all of African descent, concluded that there was a slight (odds ratio 1.44, CI: 1.12-1.86, p = 0.014) association between the rs4680(A) allele, in other words the Met encoding allele, and cocaine dependence.	[PMID 18989660] A study of the antidepressant paroxetine found better response in Met/Met homozygotes, worse effects in Val/Val homozygotes and intermediate effects in heterozygotes. The effect became significant at the third week of treatment. Paroxetine daily dose was proportional to baseline severity, but did not influence outcome.	A meta-analysis of neuroimaging studies found a significant association between the COMT genotype and prefrontal activation; strong and opposing effects were found for executive cognition paradigms (favoring Met allele carriers) and emotional paradigms (favoring Val).[PMID 19417742]	[PMID 19071221] gray matter volume and interacts with rs2097603 related to extracellular dopamine	[PMID 19207030] rs6275/DRD2 and rs4680/COMT useful in predicting disease risk among schizophrenia patients	[PMID 19037200] rs4680(G;G) carriers deprived of sleep respond quite well to 2x 100mg modafinil in terms of improved vigor and well-being, and maintained baseline performance with respect to executive functioning, whereas rs4680(A;A) individuals barely responded to the drug at all.	[PMID 16878403] Met158 allele carriers had "a more focused response...during a working memory task." "The met158 allele seems to be beneficial during the performance of working memory and attention-related tasks, whereas the val158 allele appears to be advantageous during the processing of aversive emotional stimuli."	[PMID 15673663] "Increased limbic and prefrontal activation elicited by unpleasant stimuli in subjects with more met158 alleles might contribute to the observed lower emotional resilience against negative mood states."	[PMID 12595695] In response to pain Met/Met allele carriers showed greater "sensory and affective ratings of pain and a more negative internal affective state. Opposite effects were observed in val158 homozygotes. The COMT val158met polymorphism thus influences the human experience of pain and may underlie interindividual differences in the adaptation and responses to pain and other stressful stimuli."

rs10757278	(A;A)	1.9	0.78x reduced risk for Coronary Heart Disease. 0.77x reduced risk for Brain Aneurysm and Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm.	The risk allele, rs10757278(G), shows an increased association for myocardial infarctions ("MI"; heart attacks) both in general and more specifically in so-called early onset MI. The odds ratio relative to rs10757278(A:A) "noncarrier" individuals for rs10757278(G;G) individuals is 1.64 (CI: 1.47-1.82), and for carriers of one risk allele, i.e. rs10757278(A;G) individuals, 1.26 (CI: 1.16-1.36). [PMID 17478679]	For early onset MI, the odds are slightly higher; homozygote rs10757278(G;G) individuals have an odds ratio of 2.02 (CI: 1.72-2.36), heterozygote rs10757278(A;G) individuals 1.49 (CI: 1.31-1.69) compared to noncarriers. To put it another way, men under the age of 50 and women under the age of 60 who are rs10757278(G:G) individuals have about twice the risk of having a heart attack compared to rs10757278(A:A) individuals. [PMID 17478679]	In an extension of the research reported above, the rs10757278(G) allele has been found to be associated with stroke as defined by abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA; odds ratio 1.31, p=1.2x10e-12) and Intracranial Aneurysm (odds ratio 1.29, p=2.5x10e-6), but not with type-2 diabetes.

rs10757278	(A;G)	2	1.3x risk for Heart Attack. Normal risk for Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm and Brain Aneurysm.	The risk allele, rs10757278(G), shows an increased association for myocardial infarctions ("MI"; heart attacks) both in general and more specifically in so-called early onset MI. The odds ratio relative to rs10757278(A:A) "noncarrier" individuals for rs10757278(G;G) individuals is 1.64 (CI: 1.47-1.82), and for carriers of one risk allele, i.e. rs10757278(A;G) individuals, 1.26 (CI: 1.16-1.36). [PMID 17478679]	For early onset MI, the odds are slightly higher; homozygote rs10757278(G;G) individuals have an odds ratio of 2.02 (CI: 1.72-2.36), heterozygote rs10757278(A;G) individuals 1.49 (CI: 1.31-1.69) compared to noncarriers. To put it another way, men under the age of 50 and women under the age of 60 who are rs10757278(G:G) individuals have about twice the risk of having a heart attack compared to rs10757278(A:A) individuals. [PMID 17478679]	In an extension of the research reported above, the rs10757278(G) allele has been found to be associated with stroke as defined by abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA; odds ratio 1.31, p=1.2x10e-12) and Intracranial Aneurysm (odds ratio 1.29, p=2.5x10e-6), but not with type-2 diabetes. The AA genotype appears to be protective, with 0.77x odds of developing abdominal aortic aneurysm as reported by DeCode.

rs1801133	(C;C)	0	Common genotype: normal homocysteine levels	PubMed lists over 3,000 studies linking rs1801133 to a long list of disorders in various populations across the world, of which only some are mentioned above. Considering the central role of MTHFR in folate metabolism and in control of homocysteine levels this is not surprising. A nice summary of the pathological significance of elevated homocysteine levels could be found in this article. However, despite the evidence that folic acid and other vitamins can reduce homocysteine levels, a review of 8 clinical trials concluded that the supplements provided no benefit in terms of decreasing blood clots, heart disease, cancer or overall mortality.[PMID 21069462]	With regard to gastric cancer, a meta-analysis combining 16 studies and ~2,700 patients concluded that the increased risk (odds ratio) associated with rs1801133 (T;T) and (C;T) genotypes, was 1.52 (CI 1.31-1.77) and 1.17 (CI 0.99-1.39), respectively, compared to the (C;C) genotype. Roughly the same risks were seen for Caucasians and Asians. Smoking and having low folate levels (presumably from diets low in fruits and veggies) increased the risk for (T;T) individuals from ~1.5x to ~2x, whereas having high folate levels almost reduced the risk for (T;T) genotypes pretty much down to the (C;C) level, ie. the average risk. [PMID 18162478]	Another meta-analysis of three studies on rs1801133 stratified according to dietary folate intake showed an increased risk for individuals with low folate intake (OR=1.37, CI: 0.92-2.06 for head and neck cancer and OR=1.28, CI: 0.97-1.68 for lung) versus high folate intake (OR=0.85, CI: 0.63-1.16 for head and neck cancer, and OR=0.94, CI: 0.79-1.12 for lung).[PMID 18789576]	rs1801131 and rs1801133 have been linked to increased risk for several types of brain cancer. The highest risk of meningioma was associated with heterozygosity for both MTHFR SNPs (odds ratio 2.11, CI: 1.42-3.12, p=0.002). The corresponding odds ratio for glioma was 1.23 (CI: 0.91-1.66, p=0.02. In general, risks were increased with genotypes associated with reduced MTHFR activity.[PMID 18483342]	Based on a study of 25,000 Caucasian women followed for 11 years (on average), the rs1801133(T;T) genotype individual was less likely to have migraine with aura (odds ratio 0.79, CI: 0.65-0.9 6, p = 0.02) and did not have increased risk for cardiovascular disease. However, if a (T;T) genotype did have migraine with aura, then the risk for cardiovascular disease was increased 3.66 fold (CI: 1.69-7.90, p = 0.001). This was apparently driven by a 4x increased risk for ischemic stroke (multivariable-adjusted relative risk 4.19, CI: 1.38-12.74, p = 0.01).[PMID 18672474]	A study of 677 patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) concluded that the adjusted hazard ratio for mortality in all patients was 2.27 (CI: 1.07 - 4.84, p = 0.03) for rs1801133(T;T) homozygotes, in other words, they died at about twice the rate of the other 2 genotypes over the time course of this study.[PMID 19272686]	In a case-control study of 152 cases (men) and 304 age-matched healthy controls conducted in one geographical area of Iran, evidence was seen that the MTHFR polymorphisms might contribute to increased clear cell renal cell carcinoma (CCRCC) risk in men. After controlling for confounding factors, a significant increase in CCRCC risk was found among carriers of the 677CT genotype compared with those with the 677CC genotype (odds ratio 2.21, 95% confidence interval 1.31-3.76), with a significant trend (P=0.014). Statistically significant odds ratios were also found in patients homozygous for MTHFR C677T, who have a 1.58-fold higher risk of developing CCRCC (95% confidence interval=1.21-2.44; P=0.024). Compared with the MTHFR 677CC genotype, the odds ratio (95% confidence interval) for the MTHFR 677TT genotype was 6.18 (95% confidence interval=4.75-8.34) for stage IV cancer and 4.68 (95% confidence interval=2.72-6.54) for grade 3 CCRCC (both P=0.0001).

Hepatic toxicity was increased ~2x and ~5x for heterozygous and homozygous rs1801133(T) genotypes, respectively (p=0.028). If a carrier of a rs1801133(T) allele was also a carrier of a rs70991108 deletion allele, the risk for hepatic toxicity was even higher (odds ratio 6.8, p=0.018).

rs1801133	(C;T)	2.2	1 copy of C677T allele of MTHFR = 65% efficiency in processing folic acid	PubMed lists over 3,000 studies linking rs1801133 to a long list of disorders in various populations across the world, of which only some are mentioned above. Considering the central role of MTHFR in folate metabolism and in control of homocysteine levels this is not surprising. A nice summary of the pathological significance of elevated homocysteine levels could be found in this article. However, despite the evidence that folic acid and other vitamins can reduce homocysteine levels, a review of 8 clinical trials concluded that the supplements provided no benefit in terms of decreasing blood clots, heart disease, cancer or overall mortality.[PMID 21069462]	With regard to gastric cancer, a meta-analysis combining 16 studies and ~2,700 patients concluded that the increased risk (odds ratio) associated with rs1801133 (T;T) and (C;T) genotypes, was 1.52 (CI 1.31-1.77) and 1.17 (CI 0.99-1.39), respectively, compared to the (C;C) genotype. Roughly the same risks were seen for Caucasians and Asians. Smoking and having low folate levels (presumably from diets low in fruits and veggies) increased the risk for (T;T) individuals from ~1.5x to ~2x, whereas having high folate levels almost reduced the risk for (T;T) genotypes pretty much down to the (C;C) level, ie. the average risk. [PMID 18162478]	Another meta-analysis of three studies on rs1801133 stratified according to dietary folate intake showed an increased risk for individuals with low folate intake (OR=1.37, CI: 0.92-2.06 for head and neck cancer and OR=1.28, CI: 0.97-1.68 for lung) versus high folate intake (OR=0.85, CI: 0.63-1.16 for head and neck cancer, and OR=0.94, CI: 0.79-1.12 for lung).[PMID 18789576]	rs1801131 and rs1801133 have been linked to increased risk for several types of brain cancer. The highest risk of meningioma was associated with heterozygosity for both MTHFR SNPs (odds ratio 2.11, CI: 1.42-3.12, p=0.002). The corresponding odds ratio for glioma was 1.23 (CI: 0.91-1.66, p=0.02. In general, risks were increased with genotypes associated with reduced MTHFR activity.[PMID 18483342]	Based on a study of 25,000 Caucasian women followed for 11 years (on average), the rs1801133(T;T) genotype individual was less likely to have migraine with aura (odds ratio 0.79, CI: 0.65-0.9 6, p = 0.02) and did not have increased risk for cardiovascular disease. However, if a (T;T) genotype did have migraine with aura, then the risk for cardiovascular disease was increased 3.66 fold (CI: 1.69-7.90, p = 0.001). This was apparently driven by a 4x increased risk for ischemic stroke (multivariable-adjusted relative risk 4.19, CI: 1.38-12.74, p = 0.01).[PMID 18672474]	A study of 677 patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) concluded that the adjusted hazard ratio for mortality in all patients was 2.27 (CI: 1.07 - 4.84, p = 0.03) for rs1801133(T;T) homozygotes, in other words, they died at about twice the rate of the other 2 genotypes over the time course of this study.[PMID 19272686]	In a case-control study of 152 cases (men) and 304 age-matched healthy controls conducted in one geographical area of Iran, evidence was seen that the MTHFR polymorphisms might contribute to increased clear cell renal cell carcinoma (CCRCC) risk in men. After controlling for confounding factors, a significant increase in CCRCC risk was found among carriers of the 677CT genotype compared with those with the 677CC genotype (odds ratio 2.21, 95% confidence interval 1.31-3.76), with a significant trend (P=0.014). Statistically significant odds ratios were also found in patients homozygous for MTHFR C677T, who have a 1.58-fold higher risk of developing CCRCC (95% confidence interval=1.21-2.44; P=0.024). Compared with the MTHFR 677CC genotype, the odds ratio (95% confidence interval) for the MTHFR 677TT genotype was 6.18 (95% confidence interval=4.75-8.34) for stage IV cancer and 4.68 (95% confidence interval=2.72-6.54) for grade 3 CCRCC (both P=0.0001).

Hepatic toxicity was increased ~2x and ~5x for heterozygous and homozygous rs1801133(T) genotypes, respectively (p=0.028). If a carrier of a rs1801133(T) allele was also a carrier of a rs70991108 deletion allele, the risk for hepatic toxicity was even higher (odds ratio 6.8, p=0.018).

rs1801133	(T;T)	2.8	homozygous for C677T of MTHFR = 10-20% efficiency in processing folic acid = high homocysteine, low B12 and folate levels	PubMed lists over 3,000 studies linking rs1801133 to a long list of disorders in various populations across the world, of which only some are mentioned above. Considering the central role of MTHFR in folate metabolism and in control of homocysteine levels this is not surprising. A nice summary of the pathological significance of elevated homocysteine levels could be found in this article. However, despite the evidence that folic acid and other vitamins can reduce homocysteine levels, a review of 8 clinical trials concluded that the supplements provided no benefit in terms of decreasing blood clots, heart disease, cancer or overall mortality.[PMID 21069462]	With regard to gastric cancer, a meta-analysis combining 16 studies and ~2,700 patients concluded that the increased risk (odds ratio) associated with rs1801133 (T;T) and (C;T) genotypes, was 1.52 (CI 1.31-1.77) and 1.17 (CI 0.99-1.39), respectively, compared to the (C;C) genotype. Roughly the same risks were seen for Caucasians and Asians. Smoking and having low folate levels (presumably from diets low in fruits and veggies) increased the risk for (T;T) individuals from ~1.5x to ~2x, whereas having high folate levels almost reduced the risk for (T;T) genotypes pretty much down to the (C;C) level, ie. the average risk. [PMID 18162478]	Another meta-analysis of three studies on rs1801133 stratified according to dietary folate intake showed an increased risk for individuals with low folate intake (OR=1.37, CI: 0.92-2.06 for head and neck cancer and OR=1.28, CI: 0.97-1.68 for lung) versus high folate intake (OR=0.85, CI: 0.63-1.16 for head and neck cancer, and OR=0.94, CI: 0.79-1.12 for lung).[PMID 18789576]	rs1801131 and rs1801133 have been linked to increased risk for several types of brain cancer. The highest risk of meningioma was associated with heterozygosity for both MTHFR SNPs (odds ratio 2.11, CI: 1.42-3.12, p=0.002). The corresponding odds ratio for glioma was 1.23 (CI: 0.91-1.66, p=0.02. In general, risks were increased with genotypes associated with reduced MTHFR activity.[PMID 18483342]	Based on a study of 25,000 Caucasian women followed for 11 years (on average), the rs1801133(T;T) genotype individual was less likely to have migraine with aura (odds ratio 0.79, CI: 0.65-0.9 6, p = 0.02) and did not have increased risk for cardiovascular disease. However, if a (T;T) genotype did have migraine with aura, then the risk for cardiovascular disease was increased 3.66 fold (CI: 1.69-7.90, p = 0.001). This was apparently driven by a 4x increased risk for ischemic stroke (multivariable-adjusted relative risk 4.19, CI: 1.38-12.74, p = 0.01).[PMID 18672474]	A study of 677 patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) concluded that the adjusted hazard ratio for mortality in all patients was 2.27 (CI: 1.07 - 4.84, p = 0.03) for rs1801133(T;T) homozygotes, in other words, they died at about twice the rate of the other 2 genotypes over the time course of this study.[PMID 19272686]	In a case-control study of 152 cases (men) and 304 age-matched healthy controls conducted in one geographical area of Iran, evidence was seen that the MTHFR polymorphisms might contribute to increased clear cell renal cell carcinoma (CCRCC) risk in men. After controlling for confounding factors, a significant increase in CCRCC risk was found among carriers of the 677CT genotype compared with those with the 677CC genotype (odds ratio 2.21, 95% confidence interval 1.31-3.76), with a significant trend (P=0.014). Statistically significant odds ratios were also found in patients homozygous for MTHFR C677T, who have a 1.58-fold higher risk of developing CCRCC (95% confidence interval=1.21-2.44; P=0.024). Compared with the MTHFR 677CC genotype, the odds ratio (95% confidence interval) for the MTHFR 677TT genotype was 6.18 (95% confidence interval=4.75-8.34) for stage IV cancer and 4.68 (95% confidence interval=2.72-6.54) for grade 3 CCRCC (both P=0.0001). Clin Oncol (R Coll Radiol). 2012 May;24(4):269-81. doi: 10.1016/j.clon.2011.03.005. Epub 2011 Apr 13. [PMID 21489764]	[PMID 19648163] A 2-year follow-up study of 122 newly diagnosed patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) found that carriers of a rs1801133(T) allele were at increased risk for hepatic toxicity from methotrexate treatment. Hepatic toxicity was increased ~2x and ~5x for heterozygous and homozygous rs1801133(T) genotypes, respectively (p=0.028). If a carrier of a rs1801133(T) allele was also a carrier of a rs70991108 deletion allele, the risk for hepatic toxicity was even higher (odds ratio 6.8, p=0.018).

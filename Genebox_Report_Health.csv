60	Diabetes	Diabetic Retinopathy	850494	ALR2	CT	AR, the first enzyme of the polyol pathway, probably plays an important role in the pathogenesis of the long-term complications of diabetes by means of alterations that result from sorbitol increase and myo-inositol reduction. AR is responsible for the conversion of glucose to sorbitol, which is then converted into fructose by the enzyme sorbitol dehydrogenase (SORD). During the exposition to hyperglycemia, there is an enhanced flux of AR (increased enzyme activity and expression of the aldose reductase gene-ALR2) and a reduced flux of SORD. This imbalance results in the accumulation of sorbitol, which leads to several abnormalities in cellular metabolism and hence contributes to the development of diabetic microvascular complications. The increased risk of DR associated with the presence of the C allele observed in the present study was relevant with the functional studies showing that the C allele is associated with an increased expression of AKR1B1 gene.	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?LinkName=gene_pubmed&from_uid=850494	rs759853 
61	Diabetes	Diabetic Retinopathy	7351	UCP2	GA	The uncoupling protein 2 (UCP2) is a member of the mitochondrial inner membrane carrier family and is expressed in many tissues including white adipose tissue, liver, kidney, pancreatic islets, macrophages and retinal endothelial cells and pericytes. UCP2 uncouples the substrate oxidation from the ATP synthesis, dissipating the membrane potential energy and consequently decreasing ATP production by the mitochondrial respiratory chain. The uncoupling thus leads to tissue-specific functions such as decreasing ROS formation by mitochondria, regulation of free fatty acids metabolism and inhibition of insulin secretion from beta cells. Oxidative damage due to hyperglycemia is reported to be one of the major factors contributing to the development of DPN. The main source of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in diabetes is thought to be the mitochondria. Uncoupling proteins (UCPs) can provide a controlled leak of protons across the inner membrane of the mitochondria and thus uncouple oxidative phosphorylation from respiration, with a concomitant decrease in inner mitochondrial membrane potential and free radical generation. The mitochondrial UCP families, particularly UCP2, which is expressed in various human tissues, are thought to contribute to control of body temperature and energy metabolism as well as to regulation of mitochondrial production of ROS. Therefore, the UCP2 gene is considered to be involved in DPN.	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?LinkName=gene_pubmed&from_uid=7351	rs660339

73	Diabetes	Foot Ulcers	4982	TNFRSF11B	GC	The protein encoded by this gene is a member of the TNF-receptor superfamily. This protein is an osteoblast-secreted decoy receptor that functions as a negative regulator of bone resorption. This protein specifically binds to its ligand, osteoprotegerin ligand, both of which are key extracellular regulators of osteoclast development. Local inflammation is associated with the release of proinflammatory cytokines such as interleukin (IL)-1alpha and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, which are known mediators of bone resorption via excess osteoclastic activity. These cytokines lead to an increased expression of the receptor activator of nuclear factor-kB (RANK) ligand (RANKL). Its receptor (RANK) is expressed in the membrane of preosteoclasts. RANKL stimulates the expression of nuclear factor (NFkB) that, in turn, induces the maturation of precursor cells into mature osteoclasts. At the same time, NFkB induces the glycoprotein osteoprotegerin (OPG), which acts as a decoy receptor for RANKL to avoid excess osteolysis.	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?LinkName=gene_pubmed&from_uid=4982	rs3134069

103	Diabetes	Diabetic Neuropathy	7351	UCP2	GA	The uncoupling protein 2 (UCP2) is a member of the mitochondrial inner membrane carrier family and is expressed in many tissues including white adipose tissue, liver, kidney, pancreatic islets, macrophages and retinal endothelial cells and pericytes. UCP2 uncouples the substrate oxidation from the ATP synthesis, dissipating the membrane potential energy and consequently decreasing ATP production by the mitochondrial respiratory chain. The uncoupling thus leads to tissue-specific functions such as decreasing ROS formation by mitochondria, regulation of free fatty acids metabolism and inhibition of insulin secretion from beta cells. Oxidative damage due to hyperglycemia is reported to be one of the major factors contributing to the development of DPN. The main source of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in diabetes is thought to be the mitochondria. Uncoupling proteins (UCPs) can provide a controlled leak of protons across the inner membrane of the mitochondria and thus uncouple oxidative phosphorylation from respiration, with a concomitant decrease in inner mitochondrial membrane potential and free radical generation. The mitochondrial UCP families, particularly UCP2, which is expressed in various human tissues, are thought to contribute to control of body temperature and energy metabolism as well as to regulation of mitochondrial production of ROS. Therefore, the UCP2 gene is considered to be involved in DPN.	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?LinkName=gene_pubmed&from_uid=7351	rs660339

Most Caucasians have two major isozymes, while approximately 50% of East Asians have the cytosolic isozyme but not the mitochondrial isozyme. A remarkably higher frequency of acute alcohol intoxication among East Asians than among Caucasians could be related to the absence of a catalytically active form of the mitochondrial isozyme.

138	CVD	Myocardial Infraction	100048912	CDKN2B-AS1	GG	This gene lies adjacent to the tumor suppressor gene CDKN2A in a region that is frequently mutated and deleted in a wide variety of tumors. This gene encodes a cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor, which forms a complex with CDK4 or CDK6, and prevents the activation of the CDK kinases, thus the encoded protein functions as a cell growth regulator that controls cell cycle G1 progression. The expression of this gene was found to be dramatically induced by TGF beta, which suggested its role in the TGF beta induced growth inhibition.	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?LinkName=gene_pubmed&from_uid=100048912	rs10757274
139	CVD	Myocardial Infraction	79068	FTO	TT	This gene is a nuclear protein of the AlkB related non-haem iron and 2-oxoglutarate-dependent oxygenase superfamily but the exact physiological function of this gene is not known. Other non-heme iron enzymes function to reverse alkylated Diabetic nephropathyA and RNA damage by oxidative demethylation. Studies in mice and humans indicate a role in nervous and cardiovascular systems and a strong association with body mass index, obesity risk, and type 2 diabetes.	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?LinkName=gene_pubmed&from_uid=79068	rs9939609
140	CVD	Cardiomyopathy	4000	LMNA	CC	LMNA produces the major lamin A and C proteins, and the minor A10 and C2 proteins by alternative splicing within exon 10, which are differentially expressed in a developmentally and tissue specific manner.	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?LinkName=gene_pubmed&from_uid=4000	 rs4641

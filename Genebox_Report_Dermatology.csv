1	Morphology and Texture	Acne	4609	Near MYC	AG	The closest gene around the chromosome 8q24 region is MYC, which has been known as a proto-oncogene and is a particularly compelling candidate in this region. Of interest, Myc has also been reported to regulate the androgenic effect. A Myc consensus site was identified in the androgen receptor (AR) gene to up-regulate AR. Previous studies also reported that Myc enhanced AR expression in androgen-independent prostate cancers and plays a key role in the control of hormone responsiveness and cell proliferation in epithelial prostatic cells. Besides, among the widespread microRNAs repressed by Myc, miR-let-7 was recently found to play an important role in the regulation of androgen signaling by down-regulating AR expression. It is known that higher levels of circulating androgens can lead to the hyperplasia of the sebaceous glands and the seborrhea characterized by acne, and a growing body of evidence has suggested that high levels of circulating androgens are associated with increased risk of breast cancer. Besides, prostate cancer, a well-recognized androgen-related cancer, has been positively associated with a history of severe acne in epidemiologic study. Thus, the regulation of androgen by Myc may be a common mechanism underlying the association between acne and certain cancers.	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?LinkName=gene_pubmed&from_uid=4609	rs4645948
2	Morphology and Texture	Acne	6402	Near SELL	GA	This gene encodes a cell surface adhesion molecule (selectins) that belongs to a family of adhesion/homing receptors.These selectins of adhesion molecules have important roles in regulating homoeostasis and cutaneous inflammation. L-selectin is expressed on the surface of most circulating leukocytes, facilitating leukocyte migration into secondary lymphoid organs and inflammation sites. P- and E-selectin, expressed on inflamed endothelium, are likewise responsible for the accumulation of blood leukocytes at sites of inflammation by mediating the adhesion of cells to the vascular lining. Analysis of the gene expression profiles revealed that the mRNA expression of SELL was upregulated in acne lesions. L-selectin has been shown to have an important role in mediating cutaneous inflammation by studies using gene-targeted mice. Another study also reported a highly significant negative correlation between soluble L-selectin and the inflammatory disorder diffuse systemic sclerosis (dSSc). Similarly, in mice lacking both L-selectin and intercellular adhesion molecular-1 (ICAM-1) expression, the healing of wounds is delayed, probably due to the decreased leukocyte accumulation into the wound site. Similarly, the absence of both P- and E-selectins markedly reduced recruitment of inflammatory cells and impaired closure of the wounds. Taken together, these findings implicate a potential pathogenic role of selectins in inflammation and the scar-forming processes associated with severe acne.	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?LinkName=gene_pubmed&from_uid=6402	rs12938
3	Morphology and Texture	Acne	7042	Near TGFB2	GG	This gene encodes a secreted ligand of the TGF-beta (transforming growth factor-beta) superfamily of proteins. The biology of TGFb is consistent with a role in acne pathogenesis. Keratinocyte hyperproliferation, which may lead to follicular obstruction and comedo formation in acne is inhibited by TGFb. Likewise, TGFb decreases sebaceous gland lipid production which is increased and altered in acne. Finally, innate immune responses, elicited during microbial colonization by P. acnes may be modulated by TGFb.	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?LinkName=gene_pubmed&from_uid=7042	rs1159268
4	Morphology and Texture	Acne	10468	Near FST	AG	Follistatin is a single-chain gonadal protein that specifically inhibits follicle-stimulating hormone release. FST gene encodes soluble protein product follistatin that binds to and neutralizes members of the TGFbeta superfamily, including activin, which is involved in scar formation in skin. Mice overexpressing follistatin display reduced wound healing, whereas overexpression of activin results in epidermal thickening and dermal fibrosis in normal skin and enhanced granulation tissue formation after wounding.	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?LinkName=gene_pubmed&from_uid=10468	rs478304
5	Morphology and Texture	Acne		NEAR OVOL1	GG	OVOL1 is expressed in human and murine skin, in both hair follicles and interfollicular epidermis. It encodes a zinc-finger transcription factor that is a downstream target of TGF-beta/BMP7–Smad4 signalling, a pathway known to regulate growth of keratinocytes. TGF-beta results in growth arrest of wild-type keratinocytes. A putative role of OVOL1 in skin pathology is not limited to acne since an association signal at this locus has also been reported in atopic dermatitis.	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?LinkName=gene_pubmed&from_uid=7124	rs38055
6	Morphology and Texture	Acne	7124	TNF	GG	Proinflammatory cytokines such as interleukin (IL)-1, IL-8 and tumour necrosis factor (TNF) contribute to the pathogenesis of acne. TNF has a pivotal role in inflammatory reactions and is a key regulator of the innate immune system. The inflammatory response to TNF is mediated directly and through upregulation of other cytokines. These factors may influence the pathophysiology of acne, and factors affecting TNF production may manipulate the extent of the inflammatory response, which may be useful as prognostic markers for determining the clinical severity of the disease. This gene encodes a multifunctional proinflammatory cytokine that belongs to the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) superfamily. This cytokine is mainly secreted by macrophages. This cytokine is involved in the regulation of a wide spectrum of biological processes including cell proliferation, differentiation, apoptosis, lipid metabolism, and coagulation. This cytokine has been implicated in a variety of diseases, including autoimmune diseases, insulin resistance, and cancer.	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?LinkName=gene_pubmed&from_uid=7124	rs1800629

8	Morphology and Texture	Striae Distensae	285848	Near PNPLA1	CC	The protein encoded by this gene belongs to the patatin-like phospholipase (PNPLA) family, which is characterized by the presence of a highly conserved patatin domain. PNPLA family members have diverse lipolytic and acyltransferase activities, and are key elements in lipid metabolism. While other members of this family have been well characterized, the function of this gene remained an enigma. However, recent studies show that this gene is expressed in the skin epidermal keratinocytes, and has a role in glycerophospholipid metabolism in the cutaneous barrier. Consistent with these observations, mutations in this gene are associated with ichthyosis in human (autosomal recessive congenital ichthyoses, ARCI).	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?LinkName=gene_pubmed&from_uid=285848	rs9380559
9	Morphology and Texture	Striae Distensae	2335	Near FN1	AA	This gene encodes fibronectin, a glycoprotein present in a soluble dimeric form in plasma, and in a dimeric or multimeric form at the cell surface and in extracellular matrix. The encoded preproprotein is proteolytically processed to generate the mature protein. Fibronectin is involved in cell adhesion and migration processes including embryogenesis, wound healing, blood coagulation, host defense, and metastasis.	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?LinkName=gene_pubmed&from_uid=2335	rs17449032 
10	Morphology and Texture	Striae Distensae	83872	HMCN1	GC	HMCN1 codes for Hemicentin 1. This gene encodes a large extracellular member of the immunoglobulin superfamily.

11	Morphology and Texture	Striae Distensae	2006	Near ELN	TT	ELN gene codes for Elastin. Elastin is the major component of elastic fibers, which provide reversible extensibility to connective tissue. Mutations in elastin that result in a loss of mature elastin can lead to autosomal dominant cutis laxa (a condition characterized by loose, sagging skin, and higher risks of aortic aneurysm) or supravalvular aortic stenosis (a localized narrowing of the ascending aorta caused by thickening of the aortic smooth muscle layer to compensate for the loss of elastin). ELN is also one of the genes deleted in Williams–Beuren syndrome, whose symptoms can include lax skin and supravalvular aortic stenosis, among others. This gene encodes a protein that is one of the two components of elastic fibers. Elastic fibers comprise part of the extracellular matrix and confer elasticity to organs and tissues including the heart, skin, lungs, ligaments, and blood vessels. The encoded protein is rich in hydrophobic amino acids such as glycine and proline, which form mobile hydrophobic regions bounded by crosslinks between lysine residues. Degradation products of the encoded protein, known as elastin-derived peptides or elastokines, bind the elastin receptor complex and other receptors and stimulate migration and proliferation of monocytes and skin fibroblasts. Elastokines can also contribute to cancer progression. Deletions and mutations in this gene are associated with supravalvular aortic stenosis (SVAS) and autosomal dominant cutis laxa.	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?LinkName=gene_pubmed&from_uid=2006	rs2071307

13	Photoaging	Sunburns	 4157	MC1R	GG, GG, CC, GG, GG, TT, GG	Melanocortin-1 receptor is an important gene for melanogenesis, and it codes for the G-protein-coupled receptor on melanocytes. The binding of the alpha-melanocyte-stimulating hormone (a-MSH) to the receptor is positively linked to the cAMP-signaling pathway, resulting in a switch from the biosynthesis of pheomelanin to that of eumelanin. The MC1R gene provides instructions for making aprotein called the melanocortin 1 receptor. This receptor plays an important role in normal pigmentation. The receptor is primarily located on the surface of melanocytes, which are specialized cells that produce a pigment called melanin. This intronless gene encodes the receptor protein for melanocyte-stimulating hormone (MSH). The encoded protein, a seven pass transmembrane G protein coupled receptor, controls melanogenesis. Two types of melanin exist: red pheomelanin and black eumelanin. Gene mutations that lead to a loss in function are associated with increased pheomelanin production, which leads to lighter skin and hair color. Eumelanin is photoprotective but pheomelanin may contribute to UV-induced skin damage by generating free radicals upon UV radiation. Binding of MSH to its receptor activates the receptor and stimulates eumelanin synthesis. This receptor is a major determining factor in sun sensitivity and is a genetic risk factor for melanoma and non-melanoma skin cancer. Over 30 variant alleles have been identified which correlate with skin and hair color, providing evidence that this gene is an important component in determining normal human pigment variation.	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?LinkName=gene_pubmed&from_uid=4157	rs885479
14	Photoaging	Sunburns	 3662	IRF4	CC	IRF4 gene, encoding a member of a helix-loophelix family of DNA-binding transcription factors involved in downstream regulation of interferon signaling. IRFs are primarily associated with immune system development and response. IRF4 is predominantly expressed in lymphocytes, macrophages, B-cells and dendritic cells, but also in melanocytic lineages. The IRFs are important in the regulation of interferons in response to infection by virus, and in the regulation of interferon-inducible genes. This family member is lymphocyte specific and negatively regulates Toll-like-receptor (TLR) signaling that is central to the activation of innate and adaptive immune systems. This interferon regulatory factor cooperates with MITF to activate the expression of tyrosinase in melanocytes. This function seems to be impaired in carriers of the rs12203592*T derived minor allele.	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?LinkName=gene_pubmed&from_uid=3662	rs12203592

It is encoded by a gene of the same name belonging to the HERC family, which typically encodes large protein products with C-Terminal HECT domains and one or more RCC1-like (RLD) domains. This gene belongs to the HERC gene family that encodes a group of unusually large proteins, which contain multiple structural domains. The HERC2 locus is also associated with human pigmentation variation, through the modification of the expression of OCA2, a pigmentation gene contiguous to HERC2.	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?LinkName=gene_pubmed&from_uid=8924	rs12913832

17	Photoaging	Sun spots	9515	Near STXBP5L	AG	Syntaxin 1 is a component of the 7S and 20S SNARE complexes which are involved in docking and fusion of synaptic vesicles with the presynaptic plasma membrane. This gene encodes a syntaxin 1 binding protein. In rat, a similar protein dissociates syntaxin 1 from the Munc18/n-Sec1/rbSec1 complex to form a 10S complex, an intermediate which can be converted to the 7S SNARE complex. Thus this protein is thought to be involved in neurotransmitter release by stimulating SNARE complex formation. Alternatively spliced variants have been identified, but their biological validity has not been determined.	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?LinkName=gene_pubmed&from_uid=9515	 rs322458

39	Autoimmune Disorders	Vitiligo	5698	PSMB9	GG	The immunoproteasome PSMB have been reported to be associated with several autoimmune diseases. A few case-control studies have also shown genetic variants of PSMB to be associated with vitiligo in ethnic Caucasians, suggesting a possible role in the antimelanocyte autoimmune response involved in the disease. Proteasomes are responsible for degrading short-lived cytoplasmic proteins into peptides. Among its 28 subunits, the 20S proteasome includes two subunits known as PSMB8 (LMP7) and PSMB9 (LMP2).	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?LinkName=gene_pubmed&from_uid=5698	rs17587
40	Autoimmune Disorders	Vitiligo	6890	TAP1	AA	Transporter associated with antigen processing (TAP) genes are encoded in the MHC-II region of the human HLA locus. TAP is composed of two integral membrane proteins, TAP1 and TAP2, which assemble into a heterodimer that results in a four-domain transporter. TAP1 functions by providing candidate peptides to the MHC-I molecules within the peptide-loading complex and by transporting antigen peptides from the cytoplasm into the endoplasmic reticulum. TAP has been reported to be associated with several autoimmune diseases and few case-control studies have also shown genetic variants of TAP to be associated with vitiligo in ethnic Caucasians, suggesting a possible role in the antimelanocyte autoimmune response involved in the disease.	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?LinkName=gene_pubmed&ncbi_mmode=std&from_uid=6890	rs1135216
41	Autoimmune Disorders	Vitiligo	64375	IKZF4	AA	Studies demonstrated that the combining genetic and immunological pathways might lead to lymphocyte destruction and vitiligo with immune-related diseases. IKZF4 encoding Eos, a zinc finger transcription factor of the Ikaros family, is expressed in lymphocytes and is implicated in the control of lymphoid development.	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?LinkName=gene_pubmed&from_uid=64375	rs10876864
42	Autoimmune Disorders	Vitiligo	4780	NRF2	CC	Nuclear factor erythroid - derived 2 - like 2 (Nrf2) is a pivotal transcription factor of the antioxidant response in oxidative stress-related illnesses. Studies have suggested that oxidative stress triggers the degeneration of basal layers of epidermal melanocytes. The human Nrf2 gene maps to chromosome 2q31 and consists of five exons and four introns. It was known that polymorphisms of the Nrf2 gene had effects on the affinity and expression of the Nrf2 proteins and activation of the Nrf2. Nrf2 protein, a member of the Cap - N - Collar basic leucine zipper transcription factor family, dimerizes with musculoaponeurotic fibrosarcomaor members of the activator protein 1 family in the cytoplasm. In response to oxidative stress, Nrf2 is quickly translocates into the nucleus and binds to the antioxidant response element (ARE), which is located in the upstream promoter region of many antioxidative genes.	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?LinkName=gene_pubmed&from_uid=4780	rs35652124 
43	Autoimmune Disorders	Vitiligo	5696	PSMB8	CT	This gene is located in the class II region of the MHC. Expression of this gene is induced by gamma interferon and this gene product replaces catalytic subunit 3 (proteasome beta 5 subunit) in the immunoproteasome. Aberrant presentation of self-antigens by major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules to T lymphocytes is a hallmark of autoimmune disorders. The MHC region on chromosome 6 has been implicated in many genome-wide association studies in vitiligo. Major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class-II linked genes proteasome subunit beta 8 (PSMB8) and transporter associated with antigen processing 1 (TAP1), involved in antigen processing and presentation have been reported to be associated with several autoimmune diseases including vitiligo.	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?LinkName=gene_pubmed&ncbi_mmode=std&from_uid=5696	rs2071464
44	Autoimmune Disorders	Vitiligo	22861	NLRP1	TT	Studies have associated variations in the NLRP1 gene with an increased risk of vitiligo. One of the NLRP1 gene variations associated with vitiligo changes the amino acid leucine to the amino acid histidine at position 155 in the NLRP1 protein sequence, written as Leu155His or L155H. This and other variations likely affect the activity of the NLRP1 protein, making it more difficult for the body to control inflammation and prevent the immune system from attacking its own tissues. While the pigment loss associated with vitiligo results from the immune system attacking pigment-producing cells (melanocytes) in the skin, it is unclear what specific circumstances trigger the immune system to do so.	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?LinkName=gene_pubmed&from_uid=22861	rs12150220 
45	Autoimmune Disorders	Vitiligo	22861	Near NLRP1	AA	Studies have associated variations in the NLRP1 gene with an increased risk of vitiligo. One of the NLRP1 gene variations associated with vitiligo changes the amino acid leucine to the amino acid histidine at position 155 in the NLRP1 protein sequence, written as Leu155His or L155H. This and other variations likely affect the activity of the NLRP1 protein, making it more difficult for the body to control inflammation and prevent the immune system from attacking its own tissues.

46	Autoimmune Disorders	Vitiligo	50943	FOXP3	GG, AA	The protein encoded by this gene is a member of the forkhead/winged-helix family of transcriptional regulators. Defects in this gene are the cause of immunodeficiency polyendocrinopathy, enteropathy, X-linked syndrome (IPEX), also known as X-linked autoimmunity-immunodeficiency syndrome. Regulatory T lymphocytes (Treg) are involved in the control of immune homeostasis by preventing autoimmune diseases. Treg are commonly identified by the intracellular expression of forkhead box P3 transcription factor (FOXP3) that controls their development and function. FOXP3 and ICOSL polymorphisms, modulating the activity of these immune-related genes, may predispose to AA by decreasing FOXP3 and ICOSLG expression at mRNA level. The human FOXP3 gene is located on chromosome Xp11.23 and consists of 11 exons. FOXP3 gene polymorphisms are known to alter FOXP3 protein expression and function, consequently, it is possible that polymorphisms in the FOXP3 promoter are associated with the development of vitiligo.	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?LinkName=gene_pubmed&ncbi_mmode=std&from_uid=50943	rs2232365
47	Autoimmune Disorders	Vitiligo	26191	PTPN22	GG	Protein tyrosine phosphatase non-receptor type (PTPN22) gene is mapped in the chromosomal region 1p13.3–p13.1. It codes for the phosphoprotein named lymphoid tyrosine phosphatase (LYP). This intracellular phosphatase acts as a suppressor of C-terminal Src kinase (Csk) that mediates T-cell activation by binding the proline-rich motif of the Src-homology-3 (SH3) domain. A polymorphism in PTPN22 interferes in the binding of phosphatase and Csk resulting in suppression of T-cell activation.	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?LinkName=gene_pubmed&from_uid=26191	rs2476601 
48	Autoimmune Disorders	Pemphigus Foliaceus	3812	KIR3DL2	CC	Killer cell immunoglobulin-like receptors (KIRs) are transmembrane glycoproteins expressed by natural killer cells and subsets of T cells. The KIR genes are polymorphic and highly homologous and they are found in a cluster on chromosome 19q13.4 within the 1 Mb leukocyte receptor complex (LRC). Activating KIR genes are often associated with protection in infectious diseases and susceptibility to autoimmunity. Pemphigus Foliaceus (PF) is strongly related to environmental factors, possibly due to substances contained in the saliva of hematophagous insects or to infectious microorganisms that trigger the disease in susceptible individuals. This particularity of PF may explain why activating KIR has been associated with protection against the development of this disease.	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?LinkName=gene_pubmed&ncbi_mmode=std&from_uid=3812	rs3745902
49	Autoimmune Disorders	Pemphigus Foliaceus	3904	LAIR2	CC	The protein encoded by this gene is a member of the immunoglobulin superfamily. It was identified by its similarity to leukocyte-associated immunoglobulin-like receptor 1, a membrane-bound receptor that modulates innate immune response. The protein encoded by this locus is a soluble receptor that may play roles in both inhibition of collagen-induced platelet aggregation and vessel formation during placental implantation. This gene maps to a region of 19q13.4, termed the leukocyte receptor cluster, which contains 29 genes in the immunoglobulin superfamily. LAIR-2 regulates the inhibitory potential of LAIR-1 by binding the same ligands. Altered protein levels of LAIR-1 and LAIR-2 have been associated with several autoimmune disorders and inflammatory responses, such as systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and autoimmune thyroid diseases (Grave’s and auto-immune thyroiditis). LAIR1 and LAIR2 genes are located at the chromosome 19 (19q13.4) within the leukocyte receptor complex (LRC). This region also contains the KIR (killer cell immunoglobulin-like receptors) cluster, previously studied in several Brazilian populations, with SNPs and differential expression associated with PF susceptibility.	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?LinkName=gene_pubmed&from_uid=3904	rs2042287
50	Autoimmune Disorders	Pemphigus Foliaceus	3903	LAIR1	AA, CT	The protein encoded by this gene is an inhibitory receptor found on peripheral mononuclear cells, including natural killer cells, T cells, and B cells. Inhibitory receptors regulate the immune response to prevent lysis of cells recognized as self. The gene is a member of both the immunoglobulin superfamily and the leukocyte-associated inhibitory receptor family. The gene maps to a region of 19q13.4 called the leukocyte receptor cluster, which contains at least 29 genes encoding leukocyte expressed receptors of the immunoglobulin superfamily. The encoded protein has been identified as an anchor for tyrosine phosphatase SHP-1, and may induce cell death in myeloid leukemias. Unpublished results have shown that LAIR1 mRNA levels were differentially expressed in T CD4+ cells of patients with pemphigus vulgaris (PV). PV is related to Pemphigus Foliaceus (PF) at the clinical and molecular levels. It is characterized by anti-DSG3 and often also antiDSG1 autoantibodies and by blistering predominantly in the suprabasal layer of the epidermis. In the light of these observations, it was considered that both LAIR1 and LAIR2 are strong candidates for PF susceptibility.	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?LinkName=gene_pubmed&ncbi_mmode=std&from_uid=3903	rs56802430 
51	Autoimmune Disorders	Pemphigus Foliaceus	10219	KLRG1	AA	Killer cell lectin-like receptor subfamily G member 1 (KLRG1) gene is in the natural killer (NK) cell complex (NKC) in the chromosomal region 12p13.The protein encoded by this gene belongs to the killer cell lectin-like receptor (KLR) family, which is a group of transmembrane proteins preferentially expressed in NK cells. KLRG1 codes for an inhibitory receptor expressed on the surface of mainly NK and CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, where it potentially raises their activation thresholds, ultimately preventing autoreactivity. This gene is among the six immune-related genes previously found to be differentially expressed in Pemphigus Foliaceus (PF). Polymorphisms overlapping with seed sequences can interfere with miRNA ligation, potentially disrupting or creating miRNA binding sites. The polymorphisms overlapping with predicted miRNA binding sites in the aforementioned PF-differentially expressed gene could be contributing to the variable mRNA levels. This study aims to unveil a functional mechanism for the association that may elucidate the KLRG1 mRNA differential levels previously observed in the disease.	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?LinkName=gene_pubmed&from_uid=10219
